    On Ubuntu, install prerequisite packages:
 
        sudo apt install m4
        sudo apt install make # GNU make
        sudo apt install maven mk-configure
        sudo apt install opam openjdk-8-jdk-headless
        sudo apt install pandoc
        sudo apt install sed

    Here are some other programs that must be available:

        awk
        clang+llvm-3.9.0 with development components (.h, .a/.so files)
        grep
        lex
        libarchive
        yacc

    At the top level of the RV-Predict sources, configure OCaml by running

Make sure that you have Clang 3.9 in your PATH.
