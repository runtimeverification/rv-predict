# RV-Predict Developer Guide

## Configuring a build environment

On Ubuntu, install the prerequisite packages:

```
sudo apt install m4
sudo apt install make # GNU make
sudo apt install maven mk-configure
sudo apt install opam openjdk-8-jdk-headless
sudo apt install pandoc
sudo apt install sed
sudo apt install devscripts debhelper dh-virtualenv
```

Here are some other programs that must be available:

```
awk
clang+llvm-4.0 with development components (.h, .a/.so files)
grep
lex
libarchive
yacc
```

For clang you can try:

```
sudo apt install clang-4.0
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/lib/llvm-4.0/bin/clang++ 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/lib/llvm-4.0/bin/clang 100
```

Configure an object directory if you're going to use one.

At the top level of the RV-Predict sources, configure OCaml by running

```
./opam-setup.sh
```

After it finishes, run the following command to update the environment:

```        
eval $(opam config env)
```

Make sure that you have `clang 4.0` in your PATH.

*Other notes*:

OPAM packages required by the unified error reporting in errors/:
* Probably NOT needed: zarith mlgmp 
* Definitely needed: csv uri ocamlbuild-atdgen ocp-ocamlres
* Maybe needed: uuidm camomile atdgen atdj ctypes ctypes-foreign
* Install with `opam install -y <packages here>`.

## Compiling RV-Predict

```bash
cd rv-predict
mkcmake depend
mkcmake
```

## Creating the RV-Predict distribution

```bash
cd rv-predict
mvn package
```

The distribution is packaged at `target/release/rv-predict`

Below are a few useful options:  

* `-DskipDocs` to skip generating documentation
* `-DskipTests`  to skip tests (esp. good for mvn install, as it skips the lengthy failsafe tests)
* `-Dobfuscate` if one want to run obfuscation as part of the process (disabled by default)

## Installing to $HOME

```bash
cd rv-predict
mkcmake depend
mkcmake PREFIX=$HOME install
```

## Creating the installer for RV-Predict

```bash
# Installer for RV-Predict/Java
cd rv-predict/installer
mvn clean package # the installer will be placed in `installer/target`

# Installer for RV-Predict/C
cd rv-predict/c-installer
mvn clean package  # the installer will be placed in `c-installer/target`
```

### Modifying rv-install 

The installer for rv-predict is based on [rv-install](https://github.com/runtimeverification/rv-install). It is included in `installer/pom.xml` and `c-installer/pom.xml`. 

Sometimes, you may want to modify `rv-install`, then build the installer. 
To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
# remove `rv-install` local cache.  
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/runtimeverification/install/;

cd rv-install 

mvn clean install
```

Then you can start building the installer for RV-Predict (see the previous
section).

## Deploying installer 

1. Generate a new SSH key and add it to your GitHub account.
    * [How to generate SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
    * [How to add SSH key to GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

2. Configure `~/.m2/settings.xml` to make sure that your computer can connect to company server. Ask the administrator for `username` and `password`.  

```xml
<!-- replace `***` with real username and password  -->
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>runtime-verification</id>
      <username>***</username>
      <password>***</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>runtime-verification.snapshots</id>
      <username>***</username>
      <password>***</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>rv-site</id>
      <username>***</username>
      <password>***</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

3. Add `ftp.runtimeverification.com` to your `known_hosts` file.

Advice on the web suggests adding a remote host's public key to
`known_hosts` like this:

```bash 
ssh-keyscan -t rsa ftp.runtimeverification.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

The `ssh-keyscan` manual page warns that by adding keys in this way,
you are susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  After adding a
key to your `known_hosts` in that way, always use a trustworthy secondary
source to verify a host key.

For example, examine the fingerprint of the key added by `ssh-keyscan`
by running this command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -l -F ftp.runtimeverification.com -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts 
```

If you are confident that this manual has not been tampered with, then you
can verify the `ftp.runtimeverification.com` host key by comparing the
fingerprint printed by `ssh-keygen` with one of these fingerprints---it
should match one:

```
MD5 fingerprint:       86:0d:6b:d3:91:95:f0:45:b6:26:7c:13:81:65:a6:f1 
SHA256 fingerprint:    4kbAX2bLe5oHofL0sUqyPDuaAiKgt0JGXTodWiVnGdM 
```

If there is no match, then immediately delete the key from your
`known_hosts` file.

4. Deploy installer:

First you will need to install credentials in `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` for AWS
and the `scp`ing to ftp.runtimeverification.com.  Then run:

```bash
./mvn-release.sh
```

That will build and upload a Debian package (`.deb`) for RV-Predict/C,
the GUI installers (`.jar`) for RV-Predict/C and RV-Predict/Java,
and documentation to the website, increase the version number, tag the
release sources, and add the new release to `debian/changelog`.

You should commit the changes to `debian/changelog` right away.

Without arguments, `mvn-release.sh` increases the number after the
second decimal point (the "teeny" version).  To make a release under a
particular version number---for example, 1.9---run this:

```bash
./mvn-release.sh -DreleaseVersion=1.9 -DdevelopmentVersion=1.9.1-SNAPSHOT
```

The `-DdevelopmentVersion=1.9.1-SNAPSHOT` argument tells where to
start the "teeny" releases.
