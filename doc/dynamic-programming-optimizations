To check wether there are any races, the dynamic programming model currently works with a graph composed of configurations that look like this: ((e1, e2, ..., en), (v1, v2, ..., vm)) where n is the number of threads, m is the number of variables, ei is an event index for thread i and vj is the value for variable j. Then the dynamic programming algorithm starts with the ((0, 0, ..., 0), (0, 0, ..., 0)) state and recursively expands it into all the reachable states.

This is reasonably good, but it's not necessarily better than the SMT model. Indeed, in many cases it is somehow worse.
