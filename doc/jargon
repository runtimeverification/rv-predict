Canonical Frame Address, CFA, DWARF CFA, n: the Canonical Frame Address
    (CFA) is defined by DWARF.  If an object with automatic storage
    duration is on the stack, then DWARF tells you its location with
    an offset from the CFA.  The CFA itself is commonly EBP or ESP
    or an offset therefrom.  It is constant throughout a function's
    runtime, however, its *expression* may change from instruction
    to instruction: ESP in the first instruction, EBP + constant in
    subsequent instructions, or something entirely different if you
    compile with -momit-frame-pointer.

    Fortunately, LLVM provides an intrinsic (for bitcode) and a __builtin
    (for C) for the CFA, so I can ignore some of the details.
