I have been reading about RV-Predict and thinking about NetBSD as a
model test case for RV-Predict[C].  The NetBSD operating system is a
free and open UNIX written mainly in C.  NetBSD bundles together a
kernel, user libraries and programs, source code, development tools, a
cross-compilation system, and comprehensive documentation.

I have been a developer for NetBSD for more than 10 years.

NetBSD is designed to be highly portable, and it offers stability and
performance on 68000, 80x86, Alpha, ARM, MIPS, SH4, SPARC, and other
processor architectures.  NetBSD provides several practical APIs that
abstract away the differences between machines, helping the developer to
write code for the kernel and for userspace that has a reasonable chance
of working on all of the processor and bus architectures that NetBSD
supports.  The base system contains good documentation for each of those
APIs.

I estimate that if RV-Predict[C] had a model for fewer than nine
machine-independent APIs in NetBSD, then it would be possible to use
RV-Predict[C] to detect data races in a substantial part of the kernel
while it ran with interrupts on a multicore machine.  That would be a
powerful demonstration of RV-Predict[C] on a practical operating system.
Virtually all of the models produced for NetBSD would be reusable in
other systems.

Here are NetBSD APIs whose (mis)use will affect data races in one way or
another:

Kernel threads -- kthread(9)

Software interrupts -- softint(9)

Memory barriers -- membar_ops(3)

Atomic operations -- atomic_ops(3)

Synchronization primitives (kernel)

	Change interrupt priority -- spl(9)

	Suspend preemption -- kpreempt(9)

	Mutexes -- mutex(9)

	Condition variables -- cv(9)

	Reader-writer locks -- rw(9)

Memory on devices -- bus_space(9)

Sharing memory with bus-mastering devices -- bus_dma(9)

(There is a web manual at
http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?++NetBSD-current)

Hi Dave,

It would be great if we can eventually make it work. However, RV-Predict[C]
has bigger problems than the lack of models. It doesn't have its own
analysis backend so it only supports offline analysis by reusing
RV-Predict[Java]'s backend. Also, the implementation is heavily based on
the ThreadSanitizer and we never to get to clean it up.

Besides, have you checked if ThreadSanitizer is available on NetBSD? If so,
they may have the models that we can reuse already.

In short, I think our best chance with RV-Predict is to make it work for
the bare-metal first. And then we can extend the backend for RV-Predict[C]
and replace the Java backend with it.

Thanks,
Yilong

It was my understanding that RV-Predict[C] uses a customized
ThreadSanitizer to produce the memory-read/write and branch events that
RV-Predict uses.  That is, the customized ThreadSanitizer produces the
event trace described in "Maximal Sound Predictive Race Detection with
Control Flow Abstraction":

Event ::=	begin(t)	| end(t)
	|	write(t, x, v)	| read(t, x, v)
	|	acquire(t, l)	| release(t, l)
	|	fork(t, t')	| join(t, t')
	|	branch(t)

I had assumed that the trace instrumentation was inserted during some
intermediate stage of compilation.  For example,

	intermediate representation	event
	mem[x] <- r1			write(this-thread, x, value(r1))
	r2 <- mem[y]			read(this-thread, y, value(y))

Further, I thought that you said that in your demo of RV-Predict[C] with
interrupts, you replaced ThreadSanitizer with something smaller and less
complicated that produced the same events?

Aha!  In [Bare-Metal], I see RVPredictInstrument.cpp, which seems to
derive from ThreadSanitizer.cpp.  It appears to produce a smaller set of
events than ThreadSanitizer.cpp does.

By model, I mean the correspondence between a trace event and its
logical constraints.  Am I correct that the logical constraints are
produced by the backend?

It looks to me like ThreadSanitizer.cpp produces a rich trace that
includes atomic read-modify-write, compare-and-swap, memory fences, and
function entry/exit.  That's a good start.

Tell me more about replacing the Java backend.  I suppose they will
share a lot of code?

Yes, your understanding is correct. Comparing to the paper, we eliminate
branch events in our current implementation as they greatly complicates the
backend. We need to revisit the decision in the future. Also, to rebuild
the stack trace in the final race report, we also log function entry/exit
events.

Yes. One subtlety is that we log write event before the write operation and
read event after the read operation.

So RV-Predict[Bare-Metal] doesn't need fork and join events, but it needs
more events for interrupt related operations. They are like lock and unlock
with priorities.

I see. I misinterpreted what you mean by model.

Yes.

Atomic RMW and CAS are reduced to something like "lock read write unlock"
in RV-Predict[Java/C]. We haven't considered how to incorporate memory
fences so far.

We want to have only one analysis backend implemented in C++ for
RV-Predict[C] and RV-Predict[Java]. The Java backend is quite robust but
was not developed with RV-Predict[C] in mind. Most notably, it cannot
handle memory accesses of different sizes, which is not necessary in Java.
Thus, in RV-Predict[C]'s runtime library, we translate each memory access
to multiple single-byte memory accesses. Also, it's awkward to call into
Java when running C/C++ programs, so we do not support online analysis in
RV-Predict[C]. There are probably other smaller problems too. Anyway, we
want to have one generic analysis backend for front-ends of different
languages.

Thanks,
Yilong

It seems like each memory fence ought to create a new ordering variable
o[i] and establish a must-happen-before (MHB) constraint between the new
variable, prior loads and/or stores and subsequent loads and/or stores
in the same thread.  E.g., load fence:

intermediate rep.	ordering variable	constraints
r1 <- mem[x]		o1			-
r2 <- mem[y]		o2			-
load-fence		o3			o1 < o3 && o2 < o3
						o3 < o4 && o3 < o5
r3 <- mem[p]		o4			-
r4 <- mem[q]		o5			-

Or something like that?

I am not sure I understand.  I don't think you mean that Java accesses
all memory using only the native word size.  Do you mean that the
backend does not handle accesses to the same memory location using
different widths?  For example, through a union:

	union {
		uint32_t dword;
		uint16_t word[2];
		uint8_t byte[4];
	} u;
	u.dword = 0xababcdcd;
	u.byte[3] = 0xef;

I imagine unaligned accesses are also not handled by the backend:

	uint32_t dword[2] = {0, 0};
	*(uint32_t *)(((char *)&dword[0]) + 1) = 0xffffffff;

It sounds to me like the Java backend, in spite all of its limitations,
works.  I hope that we can avoid rewriting a working program! :-)

It seems like the interface between the RV-Predict[C] and
RV-Predict[Java] frontends and the backend can be made into a binary
stream of events.  Then it is not necessary to call Java functions from
C/C++.  Both frontends should generate the same event-stream format.  We
can separate a frontend from its backend by arbitrary amounts of time
and distance; on-line and off-line become a matter of degree.

Yeah, something like that. Basically we need to relax our current formula
that is based on the assumption of sequentially consistent (SC) memory
model. However, I am not sure if it's worth the effort to go for it at this
moment.

It's not possible to obtain the native memory address in Java. Instead, we
cheat using the `identityHashCode`. There are essentially two types of
locations in Java. One is a certain field of an object. The other is an
element inside an array. In the former case, we use
`(System.identityHashCode(obj), fieldID)` as the address. In the latter
case, we use `(System.identityHashCode(array), -elementIndex)`. Thus, the
size of the access doesn't really matter in RV-Predict[Java]. In other
words, the Java backend doesn't have the concept of access size at all:
it's assuming that all memory locations are discrete and that accesses on
different locations never overlap.

Ideally, yes. But performance is kind of a big problem for RV-Predict. We
would like to avoid IPC in the common case. Also, (re-)implementing the
runtime library and the backend in C++ opens new opportunity for improving
the performance.

&gt; branch events in our current implementation as they greatly complicate=
s the<br>
&gt; backend. We need to revisit the decision in the future. Also, to rebui=
ld<br>
&gt; the stack trace in the final race report, we also log function entry/e=
xit<br>
&gt; events.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I had assumed that the trace instrumentation was inserted during =
some<br>
&gt; &gt; intermediate stage of compilation.=C2=A0 For example,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>

alue(y))<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; Yes. One subtlety is that we log write event before the write operatio=
n and<br>
&gt; read event after the read operation.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Further, I thought that you said that in your demo of RV-Predict[=
C] with<br>
&gt; &gt; interrupts, you replaced ThreadSanitizer with something smaller a=
nd less<br>
&gt; &gt; complicated that produced the same events?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Aha!=C2=A0 In [Bare-Metal], I see RVPredictInstrument.cpp, which =
seems to<br>
&gt; &gt; derive from ThreadSanitizer.cpp.=C2=A0 It appears to produce a sm=
aller set of<br>
&gt; &gt; events than ThreadSanitizer.cpp does.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So RV-Predict[Bare-Metal] doesn&#39;t need fork and join events, but i=
t needs<br>
&gt; more events for interrupt related operations. They are like lock and u=
nlock<br>
&gt; with priorities.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, have you checked if ThreadSanitizer is available on=
 NetBSD? If<br>
&gt; &gt; so,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they may have the models that we can reuse already.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; By model, I mean the correspondence between a trace event and its=
<br>
&gt; &gt; logical constraints.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I see. I misinterpreted what you mean by model.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Am I correct that the logical constraints are<br>
&gt; &gt; produced by the backend?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It looks to me like ThreadSanitizer.cpp produces a rich trace tha=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; includes atomic read-modify-write, compare-and-swap, memory fence=
s, and<br>
&gt; &gt; function entry/exit.=C2=A0 That&#39;s a good start.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Atomic RMW and CAS are reduced to something like &quot;lock read write=
 unlock&quot;<br>
&gt; in RV-Predict[Java/C]. We haven&#39;t considered how to incorporate me=
mory<br>

<br>

Yilong,

Thank you for answering my questions, it's improved my understanding
enormously.  A couple more:

A very practical approach.  Is there any protection against hash
collisions, or is that TBD?

Today I spent some time running RV-Predict[C] with the profiler 'hprof'
that comes with the JDK.

In a couple of programs, I saw the time spent in RV's method
TransitiveClosure$Builder.build() dominate all else, which makes sense
since there's an O(n^3) operation in there.  I am hopeful that the
matrix .build() updates is fairly sparse (not so?), in which case there
may be a lot of room for improvement.  Even if the matrix is not sparse,
I am hopeful that an 8x to 16x speed-up is possible.

I wrote a linked producer-consumer queue in C, deliberately leaving a
bunch of race conditions in it.  Running it with RV-Predict, I produced
a profile with these traces at the top:

CPU SAMPLES BEGIN (total = 1747) Wed Oct  5 21:59:10 2016
rank   self  accum   count trace method
   1 35.32% 35.32%     617 300823 com.microsoft.z3.Native.INTERNALsolverCheck
   2 24.73% 60.05%     432 300757 com.runtimeverification.rvpredict.smt.TransitiveClosure$Builder.build

   4  2.46% 65.25%      43 300821 com.microsoft.z3.Native.INTERNALsolverPush
   5  1.26% 66.51%      22 300296 sun.misc.Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass
   6  1.03% 67.54%      18 300081 java.lang.ClassLoader.findBootstrapClass
   7  1.03% 68.57%      18 300825 com.microsoft.z3.Native.INTERNALsolverPop
   8  0.86% 69.43%      15 300366 sun.misc.Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass
   9  0.69% 70.12%      12 300232 java.util.zip.Inflater.inflateBytes
  10  0.40% 70.52%       7 300089 java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged
	.	.	.
	.	.	.
	.	.	.

This was close to what I was expecting: most of the time spent in the
Z3 solver, a fair amount spent preparing to run the solver (that O(n^3)
closure), and much less everywhere else.  Does that jibe with your
expectations, too?

When I ran RV-Predict on a long-running C program (one of the tsan
test-cases), many top-10 traces in the profile were concerned with
reading the events.  So I can see why the performance of IPC would be a
concern.  Looking at the Java code that reads those events, I think that
I see opportunities to speed it up.

Dave

There is an experimental option to the JVM that allows us to change the
default hashing algorithm which significantly reduces the probability of
collisions. In the worst case, we would have false alarms.

This seems plausible but I usually don't trust the result from
sampling-based profilers very much. On the other hand, we care more about
the performance when there is few data races because that should
(eventually) be the common case. In other words, I think it's OK for
RV-Predict to run a bit slow as long as it spits out real data races.
However, it would be annoying if RV-Predict runs too slow during the
regression test. Therefore, in RV-Predict[Java], I have been focusing on
optimizing only the event logging module and the code that discards traces
that obviously don't contain any data race. That being said, I believe it's
possible to implement them in C++ and get another 5-10x speedup.

Offline analysis is probably not worth the time to optimize because it's
not going to be practical anyway. Online analysis is way more efficient.

Strangely enough for me, DENSO (Akiyuki) actually was not that interested
in the online version of RV-Predict[C] when we talked to him.
He said that we should start with the off-line version and then, if
everything works well, to worry about the online version.

So maybe we should then first focus on the correctness of our prediction
and on showing that we can detect more races than Hellgrind and
Tsan, so we have a strong motivation then to worry about engineering its
online predictor?  My concern is that we may spend several months
working on optimizing the online part, only to notice in the end that we do
not better in terms of prediction that the existing free tools, which
will be faster anyway in terms of runtime overhead.

Yilong,

Sample-based profiles can be misleading, but sometimes it will be
necessary for us to produce some objective performance results for
discussion.  I have been meaning to ask, is there a profiler that you
prefer to use with the JVM?  I used hprof because it was close at
hand---it comes with the JDK.

I tend to use visualvm. My experience is that it can be quite useful at
improving the performance of applications.

No, I don't really have a preference. I tend to use `System.nanoTime` to
construct a time trace.

Yeah, we will have to either instrument the assembly statically or perform
dynamic binary translation like Valgrind. Although I guess
the latter is not feasible in an embedded environment.

I don't know if it's even possible to add instrumentation to these vendor
compilers. Honestly, I don't really understand why these customers
have to stick to those vendor compilers. Would it be possible to persuade
them to use clang/gcc just in their test environment? There are
many benefits besides being able to use RV-Predict (e.g., a lot of
open-source analysis tools will be available).

Also, I know little about the iTRON OS.

The overhead of ThreadSanitizer is 5-15x. Our overhead is definitely going
to be higher because of the communication between the target and the PC.
But I have no idea how much it's going to affect the performance.

One problem would be false positives due to missing instrumentation.

Hi David,

When I said the overhead of TSan is 5x - 15x, I was actually referring to
the execution time (i.e., last item under their "common questions") and not
the size of the executable file. Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,
Yilong

Hi Kato,<br>
<br>
I am David Young, a new engineer on Dr. Rosu&#39;s team.=C2=A0 I will work<=

<br>
&gt; First of all,<br>
&gt; - Canon environment for embedded devices<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Compiler support : ARM C/C++<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0OS : iTRON<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0This combination is necessary to support when they deploy =
RV-Predict into the development process of the embedded devices<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0You might be not familiar this environment very much.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0However, this OS has quite huge share for the embedded dev=
ices in Japan.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Therefore, it is necessary iTRON support to expand RV busi=
ness in Japan.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0We need to know the estimation how long you can add iTRON =
as officially supported OS.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0And also, how long you need to add new compiler instead of=
 GCC which is providing processor vendor ?<br>
<br>
You are correct, the ARM compiler and iTRON OS are unfamiliar.=C2=A0 It is<=
br>
possible that we cannot add our instrumentation to ARM&#39;s compiler.<br>
<br>
Is it possible for Canon to use an LLVM-based compiler?=C2=A0 It is my<br>
understanding that the newest compiler from ARM, ARM Compiler 6, is<br>
based on LLVM, so Canon may headed in that direction already.=C2=A0 We are<=
br>
more familiar with the advantages of LLVM than with the advantages of<br>
vendor compilers.<br>
<br>
If necessary, we can develop instrumentation for assembly language, but<br>
that will be more effort than instrumenting C with LLVM.<br>
<br>
I do not have prior experience with iTRON.=C2=A0 I think that it should be<=
br>
possible to support it, but it is difficult to estimate the level of<br>
effort at my current level of knowledge.=C2=A0 I will find out more.<br>
<br>
&gt; - Common questions<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Compile objects and executable file<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 What percentage in comparison with GCC/Clang does the fil=
e size increase ?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Compile/Link/Execution time<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 What percentage in comparison with GCC/Clang does the ela=
psed time increase ?<br>
<br>
The increase in file size will probably be comparable to Thread<br>
Sanitizer, 5x to 15x.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t think that engineers will notice much change in the compile<br>
and link time.<br>
<br>
The first bottleneck on the execution time will be the connection<br>
between the system-under-test (SUT) and the PC.=C2=A0 Suppose that each<br>
32-bit memory-load/store generates a 128-bit trace (a conservative<br>

<br>
We may be able to preprocess the traces inexpensively on the SUT and in<br>

&gt; - RV-Predict<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 Canon&#39;s comments after demonstration,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Output<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 It seems that the analysis result put out the display onl=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 It should be generate specific formatted files like a XML=

<br>
We can provide a different output format, such as XML, if you prefer.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Terminate condition<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 For small application, it could be waiting for the proces=

<br>
Do you mean to terminate tracing and analysis?=C2=A0 I think that we can ad=
d<br>
terminate conditions (&quot;10 minutes&quot;, &quot;2,000,000 trace records=
&quot;) in a<br>
reasonable amount of effort.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Mixed compiled objects<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 As same reason as above, mixed compiled objects which som=

<br>
This should be possible, however, my colleague Yilong points out that<br>
this could produce false positives.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Running speed<br>

I have produced a set of files in rv-predict-{clang,llvm,compiler-rt}
that contain the RV-Predict[C] implementation.  The set is much smaller
than I had expected, which is a good thing.

rv-predict-clang:

	Last merged upstream at 7f42f9d4d7895f8ffc546ac4bbcc8d9a61bc9288.

	1 file changed:

	include/clang/Basic/Sanitizers.def:

	 // ThreadSanitizer
	-SANITIZER("thread", Thread)
	+SANITIZER("rvpredict", Thread)

	That's all!

rv-predict-llvm:

	Last merged upstream at 17611b180b77406671cf0819a452dd128ce7481c.

	3 files changed:

	.gitignore
	INSTALL.md
	lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/ThreadSanitizer.cpp

rv-predict-compiler-rt:

You may want to compare it against RV-Predict[Bare-metal] during the
cleanup. The existing implementation of RV-Predict[C] might have a few
small problems. For instance, I remember that it used to introduce an extra
load when logging a `read` event.

Here is an updated specification for trace files.  Major changes:

1) I don't align fields to the pointer width (e.g., to 8 bytes on a
   64-bit system).  Rather, 32-bit alignment.

2) I replace "throps" (thread/opcode tuples) with "deltops"
   (delta-PC/opcode tuples).

3) The trace header tells the trace byte order of the trace contents.

If you have any comments, feel free to share, but I expect to shelf
this effort while I pull together a very basic RV-Predict for C from
rv-predict-{llvm,clang,compiler-rt,bare-metal} and the Java backend.

Dave

***

An RV-Predict[C] event trace file starts with a header that indicates
the format and version of the file.  Following the header are the event
traces.  Traces continue right up to the end of the file, and in a
well-formed event trace, the end of file should coincide with the end of
the last trace.  In this way, you can stream a trace over a socket or
other IPC.

An RV-Predict[C] trace header is at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
header starts with 4 bytes of "magic" that serve to distinguish an
RV-Predict[C] trace file from files in other formats.  The magic
consists of the 8-bit ASCII representations for the characters 'R' 'V'
'P' '_', in that order.

Immediately following the magic is a 32-bit version number.  The initial
version number is 0.  We will increase it with every incompatible change
to the file format.  A trace-file reader MUST give up if it reads a
version number that it does not recognize.

After the version number is a 32-bit byte-order indication: this is the
word formed from the 8-bit ASCII representations of the digits 0, 1, 2,
3:  '0' | ('1' << 8) | ('2' << 16) | ('3' << 24), and written to the
stream in its producer's native byte order.  Thus, the characters appear
in the order '3' '2' '1' '0' if the producer was big-endian, and '0' '1'
'2' '3' if the producer was little-endian.

After the byte-order indication is an 8-bit pointer width.  It tells
how wide, in bytes, a pointer is.  For a trace from a 32-bit system, it
will be 4.  For a 64-bit system, 8.  You get the picture.  The reader
stores the pointer width in a variable `ptrw`.

After the pointer width is an 8-bit default data width.  The reader
should suppose that data narrower than the default data width was
converted to the default data width before it was written to the trace
file.  That is, if the default data width is 4, then 1- and 2-byte loads
and stores were "cast" to uint32_t before they were written to the trace
file.  The reader stores the pointer width in a variable `dataw`.

After the default data width there are two bytes that pad the header to
a whole number of 32-bit words.

Here is a trace header in code:

  /* RV-Predict trace file header.  Located at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
   * trace starts at the first rv_trace_t-sized boundary after the header,
   * and it ends at EOF.
   */
  struct _rv_trace_header {
          char th_magic[4];               // 'R' 'V' 'P' '_'
                                          //
          uint32_t th_version;            // 0
                                          //
          uint32_t th_byteorder;          // byte-order indication,
                                          // see discussion
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pointer_width;       // width of a pointer, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_data_width;          // default data width, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pad1[2];
  } __aligned(sizeof(uint32_t)) __packed;
  
  typedef struct _rv_trace_header rv_trace_header_t;

The event traces begin on the first 32-bit boundary after the header.
Every trace begins with a program counter (PC).  Some program counters
are special: they encode an (delta, opcode) pair, or a "deltop".  The
`delta` tells the reader by how many bytes to move the program counter
of the current thread forward or backward: it is a two's-complement
TBD-bit signed integer.  The first trace after the header MUST begin
with the special program counter that encodes the deltop (0, begin),
where 'begin' is the opcode standing for the start of a thread.  After
the program counter is the 32-bit ID for the thread that starts all
subsequent threads.

Right now I have in mind just 28 opcodes, which I assign these numbers:

        begin            0      // start of a thread
        legend           0      // alias for 'begin'
        end              1      // thread termination
        read1            2      // read: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes wide
        read2            3
        read4            4
        read8            5
        read16           6
        write1           7      // write: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes wide
        write2           8
        write4           9
        write8          10
        write16         11

The first trace helps the reader to establish an important fact that
lets it interpret the following traces: PC = (0, begin).  That
implies that

        PC + 1 = (0, end),
        PC + 2 = (0, read1),
        ...,
        PC + 27 = (0, switch).

Likewise, for an n-bit delta field,

	PC -       2^(n-1) * 28 = (-2^(n-1), begin),
	...,
	PC -             2 * 28 = (-2,       begin),
	PC -                 28 = (-1,       begin),
	PC +                 28 = ( 1,       begin),
	PC +             2 * 28 = ( 2,       begin),
	...,
	PC - (2^(n-1) - 1) * 28 = (2^(n-1) - 1, begin).

The RV-Predict[C] runtime reserved all of those counters for itself
while it ran the system under test, so the reader can be certain that
whenever they appear in the trace, there is no ambiguity: they encode a
deltop rather than an instruction address.

The first trace also helps the reader to establish some state: the
thread ID is remembered as the reader's "current thread."  The reader
interprets every event according to the current thread, so it's not
necessary to record a thread ID in every event.  Operations that
establish a new current thread are 'begin' and 'switch'.

Here are the trace formats that a reader must understand, their meaning,
and the changes that they make to the reader's current thread (`self`)
and program counter (`self.PC`).  Unless otherwise noted, every program
counter and deltop begins on the first 32-bit boundary after the
previous trace. "x*" stands for "zero or more instances of x."  Here is
the trace grammar:

traces ::= (0, 'begin') thread-ID trace*

trace ::= (delta, 'read[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it read
                `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| (delta, 'write[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it wrote
                `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| program-counter

                The current thread changed its program counter to
                `program-counter`.

		`self.PC <- program-counter`

        | (delta, 'begin') tid

		A new thread, `tid`, started.

                `tid` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: with the exception of the thread that the
                trace starts off with, `tid` must have been forked
                previously, and it must not have been ended or
                joined already.

		`t <- new tid`
		`t.PC <- self.PC + delta`
		`self <- t`

        | (delta, 'end')           

                The current thread terminated.

                Note: the current thread must not have terminated
                previously, and it must not have been joined already.

                The current thread cannot perform any deltop but
                `program-counter` or `switch`.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'join') tid

                The current thread joined `tid`.

                `tid` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: `tid` must have previously terminated with
                (delta, 'end').

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'fork') tid

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and forked a new thread, `tid`.

                Note: `tid` cannot have been forked or started
                already.  `tid` must perform `(delta, 'begin')` or
                `program-counter` before any operation other than
		`program-counter`.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'branch')

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and performed a conditional branch.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'enterfn')

		The current thread added `delta` to its program
		counter and entered a function at the new program
		counter.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'exitfn')

		The current thread added `delta` to its program
		counter and, at the new program
		counter, returned from the current function.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'acquire[n]') addr

		The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
		and acquired a lock on the `n`-byte memory region at
		address `addr`.

                `addr` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

		Note: no thread may have already locked any
		part of the region.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'release[n]') addr

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and released a lock on the `n`-byte memory
                region at address `addr`.

                `addr` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: the current thread must hold the lock on the
                identical region, no subregion or superior region.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'switch') tid

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter.  Then the current thread changed to `tid`.

		`self.PC <- self.PC + delta`
		`self <- tid`

I think that's enough information to start a conversation about the
format.

Please send me your questions and concerns.  Thanks.

Just a few for now:

* I suppose this trace format is only used when you don't want to pass the
traces via shared memory?

* Why not reduce a `read16` event to two `read8` events?

* I don't understand why `acquireN` or `releaseN` are necessary. Why not
just have events like `(delta, 'lock') lockid` and `(delta, 'unlock')
lockid`?

<br>
1) I don&#39;t align fields to the pointer width (e.g., to 8 bytes on a<br>

If you have any comments, feel free to share, but I expect to shelf<br>

rv-predict-{llvm,clang,<wbr>compiler-rt,bare-metal} and the Java backend.<b=

<br>
***<br>
<br>
An RV-Predict[C] event trace file starts with a header that indicates<br>
the format and version of the file.=C2=A0 Following the header are the even=
t<br>
traces.=C2=A0 Traces continue right up to the end of the file, and in a<br>
well-formed event trace, the end of file should coincide with the end of<br=
>
the last trace.=C2=A0 In this way, you can stream a trace over a socket or<=
br>
other IPC.<br>
<br>
An RV-Predict[C] trace header is at byte 0 of a trace file.=C2=A0 The<br>
header starts with 4 bytes of &quot;magic&quot; that serve to distinguish a=
n<br>
RV-Predict[C] trace file from files in other formats.=C2=A0 The magic<br>
consists of the 8-bit ASCII representations for the characters &#39;R&#39; =
&#39;V&#39;<br>
&#39;P&#39; &#39;_&#39;, in that order.<br>
<br>
Immediately following the magic is a 32-bit version number.=C2=A0 The initi=
al<br>
version number is 0.=C2=A0 We will increase it with every incompatible chan=
ge<br>
to the file format.=C2=A0 A trace-file reader MUST give up if it reads a<br=
>
version number that it does not recognize.<br>
<br>
After the version number is a 32-bit byte-order indication: this is the<br>
word formed from the 8-bit ASCII representations of the digits 0, 1, 2,<br>
3:=C2=A0 &#39;0&#39; | (&#39;1&#39; &lt;&lt; 8) | (&#39;2&#39; &lt;&lt; 16)=
 | (&#39;3&#39; &lt;&lt; 24), and written to the<br>
stream in its producer&#39;s native byte order.=C2=A0 Thus, the characters =
appear<br>
in the order &#39;3&#39; &#39;2&#39; &#39;1&#39; &#39;0&#39; if the produce=
r was big-endian, and &#39;0&#39; &#39;1&#39;<br>
&#39;2&#39; &#39;3&#39; if the producer was little-endian.<br>
<br>
After the byte-order indication is an 8-bit pointer width.=C2=A0 It tells<b=
r>
how wide, in bytes, a pointer is.=C2=A0 For a trace from a 32-bit system, i=
t<br>
will be 4.=C2=A0 For a 64-bit system, 8.=C2=A0 You get the picture.=C2=A0 T=
he reader<br>
stores the pointer width in a variable `ptrw`.<br>
<br>
After the pointer width is an 8-bit default data width.=C2=A0 The reader<br=
>
should suppose that data narrower than the default data width was<br>
converted to the default data width before it was written to the trace<br>
file.=C2=A0 That is, if the default data width is 4, then 1- and 2-byte loa=
ds<br>
and stores were &quot;cast&quot; to uint32_t before they were written to th=
e trace<br>
file.=C2=A0 The reader stores the pointer width in a variable `dataw`.<br>
<br>
After the default data width there are two bytes that pad the header to<br>
a whole number of 32-bit words.<br>
<br>
Here is a trace header in code:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 /* RV-Predict trace file header.=C2=A0 Located at byte 0 of a trace =
file.=C2=A0 The<br>

The event traces begin on the first 32-bit boundary after the header.<br>
Every trace begins with a program counter (PC).=C2=A0 Some program counters=
<br>
are special: they encode an (delta, opcode) pair, or a &quot;deltop&quot;.=
=C2=A0 The<br>
`delta` tells the reader by how many bytes to move the program counter<br>
of the current thread forward or backward: it is a two&#39;s-complement<br>
TBD-bit signed integer.=C2=A0 The first trace after the header MUST begin<b=
r>
with the special program counter that encodes the deltop (0, begin),<br>
where &#39;begin&#39; is the opcode standing for the start of a thread.=C2=
=A0 After<br>
the program counter is the 32-bit ID for the thread that starts all<br>
subsequent threads.<br>

The RV-Predict[C] runtime reserved all of those counters for itself<br>
while it ran the system under test, so the reader can be certain that<br>
whenever they appear in the trace, there is no ambiguity: they encode a<br>
deltop rather than an instruction address.<br>
<br>
The first trace also helps the reader to establish some state: the<br>
thread ID is remembered as the reader&#39;s &quot;current thread.&quot;=C2=
=A0 The reader<br>
interprets every event according to the current thread, so it&#39;s not<br>
necessary to record a thread ID in every event.=C2=A0 Operations that<br>
establish a new current thread are &#39;begin&#39; and &#39;switch&#39;.<br=
>
<br>
Here are the trace formats that a reader must understand, their meaning,<br=
>
and the changes that they make to the reader&#39;s current thread (`self`)<=
br>
and program counter (`self.PC`).=C2=A0 Unless otherwise noted, every progra=
m<br>
counter and deltop begins on the first 32-bit boundary after the<br>
previous trace. &quot;x*&quot; stands for &quot;zero or more instances of x=
.&quot;=C2=A0 Here is<br>
the trace grammar:<br>

Not necessarily.  It's a compact representation that's cheap to produce,
and I expect to write a subset of these traces more-or-less directly to
per-thread ring buffers.

Some operations, like 'switch', won't appear on a ring; rather, the
transmission process will synthesize them.  Also, there's no need to
write the header to a ring buffer.

The read16 follows from what I see in rv-predict-baremetal, where there
are discrete event types for 1-, 2-, ..., and 16-byte reads and writes.

The idea is to use those as primitives for performing atomic operations
(bitwise-and, and -or, add and subtract, swap, compare-and-set).  Atomic
operations are at least nominally in different widths.

But could you have atomic operations on the same addr with different widths
at C level? I have not yet encountered such case before. Also, I think we
still want `lock` and `unlock` events since they represent the most common
synchronization idiom.

Me neither.  It seems likely that there is either a 64-bit processor
that has a 128-bit integer type, or there is a SIMD instruction set that
does.

> at C level?

I think so.  For example, we can write this (possibly undefined?) code:

	union {
		struct {
			uint32_t x, y;
		} narrow;
		uint64_t wide;
	} u = {{0, 0}};

	// ...
	atomic_fetch_add(&u.narrow.x, 1);	// thread 1
	// ...
	atomic_fetch_add(&u.wide, 1);		// thread 2

Yeah.  At the very least, lock/unlock will be necessary when a program
wants mutual exclusion on entities that are not one-to-one with memory
addresses.

At second thought, I am leaning towards having direct support for atomic
operations in both frontend and backend. The trace is more compact and the
formula is more concise this way.

The branch event in the middle doesn't look right to me. I haven't thought
it through. In fact, I am not a fan of the branch event: I believe static
analysis is the better solution (the compiler has to perform the same
analysis regardless). Anyway, I would like to leave the `branch` event out
of the discussion for now.

First of all, we need to have `atomic-load` and `atomic-store`. Second,
from the backend's perspective, the difference between `atomic-swap` and
`atomic-rmw` doesn't really matter. All it needs to build the formula is
something like `atomic-read-then-write value1 value2` which reads `value1`
and writes `value2` atomically.

Another interesting question to think about is how to
`atomic-read-then-write` properly. Obviously, we can only get `value1`
after the atomic operation is done. But if we simply log the event after
the atomic operation and there is a `read value2` in another thread, how
can we make sure that the `atomic-read-then-write` is not written to a
later window than `read value2`? I "solved" this problem in
RV-Predict[Java] by introducing an extra lock to enforce the correct
ordering. Is there a better solution? Could we split the logging of
`atomic-read-then-write` into two parts by first writing a stub event and
complete it after the operation is done? Anyway, it's something we need to
think about before implementing the event logging subsystem.

After a second look at the PLDI paper, it seems that a 'branch' event
indicates that the memory *addresses* subsequently read and written may
have been affected by the *value* of prior reads, but it has nothing to
say about the *values* subsequently read and written.  So an atomic RMW
should produce no 'branch', because the same address will be written,
regardless of what value is read.  An atomic CAS, however, may or may
not write, so it seems proper to log a branch between the read and
write.

I did not understand your remarks about static analysis.  Does the
current backend handle branch events?  If not, then maybe we should put
off further talk about branches until another time.

Ok.

I have some concerns about the instrumentation of atomic loads and
stores that I will save for another email.

That *is* an interesting question.

No, the current backend doesn't handle the `branch` events. They are
dropped because the extra complexity they would add to the implementation.
We may revisit this decision in the future. On the other hand, `branch`
events basically capture the notion of control-dependency in a dynamic way.
Since the compiler has to compute basic blocks anyway, I doubt using
`branch` events is our best solution.

Guys, the reason I asked David to look into this is because our
distributors in Japan, Marubeni SYS, said that Toshiba is interested
in buying licenses of both RV-Match and RV-Predict and they want
to do it some time in November.  Specifically, I understand that
the director in charge of analysis tools at Toshiba has allocated
budget specifically for our tools.  Thus, I was thinking that we may
want to give them something that works, even if it is not necessarily
the way we want it to.  So I was hoping that if we replace the heavy
instrumentation in the rv-predict[c] that Traian and Yilong developed
which required a custome LLVM with the new instrumentation that
is implemented as a normal LLVM pass, then maybe we get something
workable quickly?  I may be wrong, it was just a thought.  Let me know
what you think.

Thanks,
Grigore

I am not sure I understand the choice here. Does Toshiba want RV-Predict[C]
or RV-Predict[Bare-metal]? Or they have needs for both of them? I
personally believe RV-Predict[Bare-metal] is easier to be made workable
because it's significantly simpler in nature. The front-end of
RV-Predict[C] can be separated from the LLVM source tree quite easily but
making it works well with the backend will surely take time. I don't even
have a clear roadmap regarding what need to be done. On the other hand,
RV-Predict[Bare-metal] only needs a C backend to be complete! It's really
easy to implement since the encoding for interrupts is much simpler than
multi-threading. I estimate the workload to be 2~3 weeks of full-time
development if you already understand the maximal causal model. Also, there
is little risk in getting stuck because we already have a reference
implementation of the (more complex) backend in RV-Predict[Java].

Thanks,
Yilong

>From what I've seen, I am not sure MSYS understands RV-Predict[bare-metal]
enough to
demonstrate it.  What they had from us was whatever Phil gave them or
whatever they
downloaded from our website, at https://runtimeverification.com/predict/.
Phil, can you
please let us know what we gave MSYS to demonstrate to potential
customers?  So I'm
assuming it is RV-Predict[C].  In fact, Akiyuki even asked us specifically
in our meetings
about the new project we just started that we should not worry about
running things on
a board; desktop execution and off-line is good enough for their needs.

But it currently works well enough according to the examples at
https://runtimeverification.com/predict/c/docs/runningexamples/.
>From a company point of view, we put several months, maybe even more than
one year
of man-work (Traian mostly, but also Edgar and Philip and you, Yilong,
providing feedback
on how to incorporate the Java backend) to adapt the RV-Predict[C] backend
to work with
the LLVM instrumentation.  Are we just throwing that away?  That is at best
uneconomical.

I'm open to whatever works, but from distance there seems to be a bigger
risk to implement
a whole new backend in C with the existing better instrumentation,  instead
of using the
existing Java one, that we've already used successfully with a bad C
instrumentation, with
the new existing instrumentation.

Traian, Phil, can you guys please also tell us what you think?  If we
decide to go with the
new and throw away the old, then I think we should have and follow a very
strict plan on how
to complete it.  I just don't want to see the same RV-Predict pattern
happen again.  For the
new people, here is the plan that I'm talking about:
Implementation 0: The company signs an agreement with UIUC to commercialize
jPredictor (ICSE'08).
Reimplementation 1: Pat does not like jPredictor's causal cone static
analysis anymore, so
he reimplements it into RV-Predict, using vector clocks, some graphical
interface, and two
years of two summer interns each.
Reimplementation 2: Jeff does not like Pat's implementation, so he throws
away everything
and starts a completely new implementation, based on SMT solving and
conditional events.
The entire thing turns out to be a lot more efficient than before, but the
whole previous
codebase is more or less thrown away.
Reimplementation 3: Yilong reimplements the entire thing, making it faster,
but also gives up
the conditional events for performance reasons.  It only works for Java.
Implementation 4: Traian, Edgar, Philip implement a C frontend using LLVM
instrumentation,
but it requires a heavy customization of the entire LLVM, so it ends up
having 800MB or so.
Re-implementation 5: Now Yilong implements RV-Predict[bare-metal], which
gives us a smarter
instrumentation, but it still does not have a backend to generate and solve
constraints.

Not sure if the above can be framed as a success story or not.  It
certainly cost the company
$300,000 or more and we still have not got any revenue from RV-Predict.
Sorry to put things
so bluntly, but somebody has to.  The question is what is our fastest way
to get something
usable in Toshiba's hands asap.  To me, putting together the new and light
LLVM instrumentation
with the backend of the existing RV-PRedict[C] at
https://runtimeverification.com/predict/c/docs/runningexamples/ seems like
a low-hanging fruit.
Why is implementing (and debugging, tuning, etc.) a new backend better at
this stage?

Grigore

I don't think the discussion here is mainly about on-board execution or
online analysis. It's more about what kind of race they want to detect?

I am not talking about throwing it away. The front-ends of RV-Predict[C]
and RV-Predict[bare-metal] are not the same. The latter makes
domain-specific assumptions to make it much simpler and faster. Actually,
after second thought, the RV-Predict[C] front-end will do just fine. The
problem is more on the Java backend side, which is not designed with the
byte-addressable model in mind.

Traian, could you remind me how you work around problems like unaligned
memory accesses and memory accesses that are shorter than a word?

Because of the above reason, the existing Java backend does not work
out-of-the-box with RV-Predict[bare-metal].

Well, not really a re-implementation from my view. Jeff's version of
RV-Predict is only good enough for the evaluation of the paper. The
instrumentation doesn't handle a lot of Java 7/8 constructs correctly.
There is no mechanism to deal with the Java standard library. Together with
Traian, the overall performance has been improved for over at least 1000x.
The formula also changes quite a bit to separate the encoding of thread
interleavings and that of race conditions. Not to mention there are
countless bugs/corner-cases to fix/handle. I can't comment on the previous
attempts but the current state of RV-Predict[Java] (quite robust and
reasonably efficient) surely involves tons of new work beyond the academic
version in PLDI. Strictly speaking, the rewriting of the old code to make
them manageable was done in less than 2-3 months.

OK, if this can be something Toshiba is interested in, David can probably
pull out the instrumentation and organize it using the same trick as
RV-Predict[bare-metal] in a few days. I don't see why Toshiba would choose
RV-Predict[C] in this form over TSan. However, I am not against it because,
who knows, they may get interested and request to try
RV-Predict[bare-metal].

Here are my thoughts on the RV-Predict[C] frontend status.
This is a general overview.  Since I was traveling, I ingested a lot of
emails at once and thus I might have missed some questions; if I did,
please ask them again and I'll do my best to give more specific answers.


* Since we were always running against the clock, we decided to use the
TSan instrumentation (part of the larger compiler-rt) as a front-end, and
customize it to our needs.
Therefore, the effort spent should not be considered as a full
(re)implementation, but just as adjustments to an existing framework.  For
reference, we only added/changed ~10% of the tsan rtl codebase (we added
less than 2k lines on a 15k project, not counting the generic sanitizer
infrastructure).

* What we actually added/changed into the TSan codebase was (1) tracking
the values read/written as our model takes them into account; and (2)
recording the trace to disk which, after several prototypes was implemented
by Eric to match the thread-based binary format of the Java backend.

* A huge performance issue, as Yilong noted, is that in order to fit the
Java backend, we record memory events at byte-level, but as they were
longs;  in particular this means that e.g,  we would record 8 events for
the an access event to a 64-bit long.  Aside from the size of the trace,
this has impact on the analysis precision/efficiency, as we need to
increase our window ~4 times to capture a similar amount of "real" events
as we would in Java, and this in turn increases our SMT solving time
accordingly.

Therefore, if we are to take this out of the prototype stage, we would need
some adjustments to our causal model and backend implementation to handle
variable-length memory accesses.

Thus being said, I think it is OK to keep using this frontend as-is as long
as we keep using the Java backend unchanged; moreover, the tsan
instrumentation is sensitive to variable-length and unaligned memory
accesses, so we could build on it even if we decide to implement a new
backend / modify our existing backend to consider the C memory model.

If we decide to implement a front-end of our own, I would say that it's
worthwhile to analyze the compiler-rt code, both for the comprehensive set
of library function they wrap around and generate events for, and for the
ways they have to achieve this taking advantage of the order in which
functions are looked up at execution time.

Finally, although we haven't explored this avenue more, note that the
compiler-rt project can be compiled for both llvm and gcc and ships with
both llvm and gcc; therefore, we could probably tune our code so that we
only ship the dynamic libraries and have them override (either directly, or
using a LD_LIBRARY_LOAD) the default libraries installed (or not) by llvm
or gcc; this way our frontend would be a replacement for the standard
-fsanitize=thread option that the official distributions of both clang and
gcc provide.
There is currently one issue with this approach:  in order to capture the
values being written we modified the ThreadSanitizer.cpp in the llvm
codebase; this is why we cannot used a precompiled llvm/gcc directly and
have to rebuild and ship a customized version of llvm.  A workaround for
this for llvm is to make this a bytecode transformer as Yilong did with
bare-metal.  I don't know whether similar mechanisms are available for gcc
without requiring recompilation. Another option would be to read the memory
before being written and to attempt inferring written values from future
read references.  It might be worthwhile, as it would make us compliant
with compiler-rt and allow easy integration with standard clang/gcc but
this seems to require some tuning and careful considerations.

best wishes,
Traian

<div dir=3D"ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Her=
e are my thoughts on the RV-Predict[C] frontend status.<br><div>This is a g=
eneral overview.=C2=A0 Since I was traveling, I ingested a=20
lot of emails at once and thus I might have missed some questions; if I=20
did, please ask them again and I&#39;ll do my best to give more specific=20
answers.<br></div><br><br></div>* Since we were always running against the =
clock, we decided to use the TSan instrumentation (part of the larger compi=
ler-rt) as a front-end, and customize it to our needs.<br></div>Therefore, =
the effort spent should not be considered as a full (re)implementation, but=
 just as adjustments to an existing framework.=C2=A0 For reference, we only=
 added/changed ~10% of the tsan rtl codebase (we added less than 2k lines o=
n a 15k project, not counting the generic sanitizer infrastructure).<br><br=
></div>* What we actually added/changed into the TSan codebase was (1) trac=
king the values read/written as our model takes them into account; and (2) =
recording the trace to disk which, after several prototypes was implemented=
 by Eric to match the thread-based binary format of the Java backend.<br></=
div></div><div></div><div><br></div>* A huge performance issue, as Yilong n=
oted, is that in order to fit the Java backend, we record memory events at =
byte-level, but as they were longs;=C2=A0 in particular this means that e.g=
,=C2=A0 we would record 8 events for the an access event to a 64-bit long.=
=C2=A0 Aside from the size of the trace, this has impact on the analysis pr=
ecision/efficiency, as we need to increase our window ~4 times to capture a=
 similar amount of &quot;real&quot; events as we would in Java, and this in=
 turn increases our SMT solving time accordingly.=C2=A0 <br><br>Therefore, =
if we are to take this out of the prototype stage, we would need some adjus=
tments to our causal model and backend implementation to handle variable-le=
ngth memory accesses.<br><br></div>Thus being said, I think it is OK to kee=
p using this frontend as-is as long as we keep using the Java backend uncha=
nged; moreover, the tsan instrumentation is sensitive to variable-length an=
d unaligned memory accesses, so we could build on it even if we decide to i=
mplement a new backend / modify our existing backend to consider the C memo=
ry model.<br></div><br><div>If we decide to implement a front-end of our ow=
n, I would say that=20
it&#39;s worthwhile to analyze the compiler-rt code, both for the=20
comprehensive set of library function they wrap around and generate=20
events for, and for the ways they have to achieve this taking advantage=20
of the order in which functions are looked up at execution time.<br><br></d=
iv>Finally, although we haven&#39;t explored this avenue more, note that th=
e=20
compiler-rt project can be compiled for both llvm and gcc and ships with
 both llvm and gcc; therefore, we could probably tune our code so=20
that we only ship the dynamic libraries and have them override (either=20
directly, or using a LD_LIBRARY_LOAD) the default libraries installed=20
(or not) by llvm or gcc; this way our frontend would be a replacement for t=
he standard -fsanitize=3Dthread option that the official distributions of b=
oth clang and gcc provide.=C2=A0=C2=A0 <br><div>There is currently one issu=
e with this approach:=C2=A0 in order to capture the values being written we=
 modified the ThreadSanitizer.cpp in=20
the llvm codebase; this is why we cannot used a precompiled llvm/gcc
 directly and have to rebuild and ship a customized version of llvm.=C2=A0 =
A workaround for this for llvm is to make this a bytecode=20
transformer as Yilong did with bare-metal.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know whether s=
imilar
 mechanisms are available for gcc without requiring recompilation. Another =
option would be to read the memory before being written and to attempt infe=
rring written values from future read references.=C2=A0 It might be worthwh=
ile, as it would make us compliant with compiler-rt and allow easy integrat=
ion with standard clang/gcc but this seems to require some tuning and caref=
ul considerations.<br></div><br></div></div></div>best wishes,<br></div>Tra=

Just to follow up on some points from my perspective:

- As I'm sure you guys know, what I gave MSYS was Traian's (at the time 
latest) RV-Predict[C] (with examples, in a Vagrant VM). This was for 
demonstration purposes mainly, and I believe we told them that it was an 
unfinished effort/prototype and we would need to develop instrumentation 
frontends for any target architecture their customers wanted.

- I do think RV-Predict[bare metal] needs to happen eventually for the 
product to be useful for the customers we talked to in Japan; whether it 
will happen by November/ET I am not sure.

- The changes to the Java backend for efficiency (allowing larger window 
sizes) may be premature if no customers have complained about 
performance.  I would focus on whatever they need to get some output 
from the tool on their codebase, and let them know that we have upgrades 
in the works that will provide significant efficiency improvements.  
IMO, whatever the bare minimum is to get their code running through 
RV-Predict is what needs to happen.

- As for why they wouldn't just use ThreadSan, they will use our tool 
even if TSan could potentially be better because we will provide them 
with support and potentially tailor the tools to fit their needs.  
That's where the value is for the big companies more than just number of 
races detected or tool efficiency.

- I have no idea what Toshiba's stack looks like or what devices they 
want to run this on.  Not sure if you guys do as I've only been 
partially following these threads, but if not this information needs to 
be solicited ASAP.  Are they running this on desktop C code or bare metal?

- If they're also looking to run RV-Match on the same code, it might be 
nice as a long term goal to eventually provide a unified run script that 
will run their codebase through both.

- If they are seriously going to buy our tools, we should schedule an 
on-site visit and make sure to talk to the engineers who are going to be 
responsible for this integration.  It is important that they understand 
how to use the tools and the limitations of the tools, and it's 
important that we understand how they are using the tools.  I can't 
emphasize that tight feedback loop enough, so ask MSYS to help set this 
up.  If they are putting money on the table they are our first real 
customer, and making sure they are satisfied and that they can run their 
code through our tools takes priority over any other work we may want to 
do for others and is critical to the continued success of the company 
(especially in Japan; reputation is very important, and the last thing 
we want is a bad reputation with Toshiba, their affiliates, everyone 
they talk to, and by extension MSYS and future customers).

So tl;dr whatever they have, get it to work for them and do the bare 
minimum that is required to get it to work for them, whether it is with 
the C or bare metal variant.

  </head>
  <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
    <p>Just to follow up on some points from my perspective:</p>
    <p>- As I'm sure you guys know, what I gave MSYS was Traian's (at
      the time latest) RV-Predict[C] (with examples, in a Vagrant VM).
      This was for demonstration purposes mainly, and I believe we told
      them that it was an unfinished effort/prototype and we would need
      to develop instrumentation frontends for any target architecture
      their customers wanted.</p>
    <p>- I do think RV-Predict[bare metal] needs to happen eventually
      for the product to be useful for the customers we talked to in
      Japan; whether it will happen by November/ET I am not sure.<br>
    </p>
    <p>- The changes to the Java backend for efficiency (allowing larger
      window sizes) may be premature if no customers have complained
      about performance. I would focus on whatever they need to get
      some output from the tool on their codebase, and let them know
      that we have upgrades in the works that will provide significant
      efficiency improvements. IMO, whatever the bare minimum is to get
      their code running through RV-Predict is what needs to happen. <br>
    </p>
    <p>- As for why they wouldn't just use ThreadSan, they will use our
      tool even if TSan could potentially be better because we will
      provide them with support and potentially tailor the tools to fit
      their needs. That's where the value is for the big companies more
      than just number of races detected or tool efficiency.<br>
    </p>
    <p>- I have no idea what Toshiba's stack looks like or what devices
      they want to run this on. Not sure if you guys do as I've only
      been partially following these threads, but if not this
      information needs to be solicited ASAP. Are they running this on
      desktop C code or bare metal?</p>
    <p>- If they're also looking to run RV-Match on the same code, it
      might be nice as a long term goal to eventually provide a unified
      run script that will run their codebase through both.</p>
    <p>- If they are seriously going to buy our tools, we should
      schedule an on-site visit and make sure to talk to the engineers
      who are going to be responsible for this integration. It is
      important that they understand how to use the tools and the
      limitations of the tools, and it's important that we understand
      how they are using the tools. I can't emphasize that tight
      feedback loop enough, so ask MSYS to help set this up. If they
      are putting money on the table they are our first real customer,
      and making sure they are satisfied and that they can run their
      code through our tools takes priority over any other work we may
      want to do for others and is critical to the continued success of
      the company (especially in Japan; reputation is very important,
      and the last thing we want is a bad reputation with Toshiba, their
      affiliates, everyone they talk to, and by extension MSYS and
      future customers).</p>
    <p>So tl;dr whatever they have, get it to work for them and do the
      bare minimum that is required to get it to work for them, whether
      it is with the C or bare metal variant.<br>
    </p>

                            <div>Here are my thoughts on the
                              RV-Predict[C] frontend status.<br>
                              <div>This is a general overview. Since I
                                was traveling, I ingested a lot of
                                emails at once and thus I might have
                                missed some questions; if I did, please
                                ask them again and I'll do my best to
                                give more specific answers.<br>
                              </div>
                              <br>
                              <br>
                            </div>
                            * Since we were always running against the
                            clock, we decided to use the TSan
                            instrumentation (part of the larger
                            compiler-rt) as a front-end, and customize
                            it to our needs.<br>
                          </div>
                          Therefore, the effort spent should not be
                          considered as a full (re)implementation, but
                          just as adjustments to an existing framework.
                          For reference, we only added/changed ~10% of
                          the tsan rtl codebase (we added less than 2k
                          lines on a 15k project, not counting the
                          generic sanitizer infrastructure).<br>
                          <br>
                        </div>
                        * What we actually added/changed into the TSan
                        codebase was (1) tracking the values
                        read/written as our model takes them into
                        account; and (2) recording the trace to disk
                        which, after several prototypes was implemented
                        by Eric to match the thread-based binary format
                        of the Java backend.<br>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div><br>
                    </div>
                    * A huge performance issue, as Yilong noted, is that
                    in order to fit the Java backend, we record memory
                    events at byte-level, but as they were longs; in
                    particular this means that e.g, we would record 8
                    events for the an access event to a 64-bit long.
                    Aside from the size of the trace, this has impact on
                    the analysis precision/efficiency, as we need to
                    increase our window ~4 times to capture a similar
                    amount of "real" events as we would in Java, and
                    this in turn increases our SMT solving time
                    accordingly. <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, if we are to take this out of the
                    prototype stage, we would need some adjustments to
                    our causal model and backend implementation to
                    handle variable-length memory accesses.<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                  Thus being said, I think it is OK to keep using this
                  frontend as-is as long as we keep using the Java
                  backend unchanged; moreover, the tsan instrumentation
                  is sensitive to variable-length and unaligned memory
                  accesses, so we could build on it even if we decide to
                  implement a new backend / modify our existing backend
                  to consider the C memory model.<br>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>If we decide to implement a front-end of our own, I
                  would say that it's worthwhile to analyze the
                  compiler-rt code, both for the comprehensive set of
                  library function they wrap around and generate events
                  for, and for the ways they have to achieve this taking
                  advantage of the order in which functions are looked
                  up at execution time.<br>
                  <br>
                </div>
                Finally, although we haven't explored this avenue more,
                note that the compiler-rt project can be compiled for
                both llvm and gcc and ships with both llvm and gcc;
                therefore, we could probably tune our code so that we
                only ship the dynamic libraries and have them override
                (either directly, or using a LD_LIBRARY_LOAD) the
                default libraries installed (or not) by llvm or gcc;
                this way our frontend would be a replacement for the
                standard -fsanitize=thread option that the official
                distributions of both clang and gcc provide. <br>
                <div>There is currently one issue with this approach:
                  in order to capture the values being written we
                  modified the ThreadSanitizer.cpp in the llvm codebase;
                  this is why we cannot used a precompiled llvm/gcc
                  directly and have to rebuild and ship a customized
                  version of llvm. A workaround for this for llvm is to
                  make this a bytecode transformer as Yilong did with
                  bare-metal. I don't know whether similar mechanisms
                  are available for gcc without requiring recompilation.
                  Another option would be to read the memory before
                  being written and to attempt inferring written values
                  from future read references. It might be worthwhile,
                  as it would make us compliant with compiler-rt and
                  allow easy integration with standard clang/gcc but
                  this seems to require some tuning and careful
                  considerations.<br>

                                              not the same. The latter
                                              makes domain-specific

                                              front-end will do just
                                              fine. The problem is more
                                              on the Java backend side,
                                              which is not designed with

                                              RV-Predict is only good
                                              enough for the evaluation
                                              of the paper. The
                                              instrumentation doesn't
                                              handle a lot of Java 7/8
                                              constructs correctly.
                                              There is no mechanism to
                                              deal with the Java
                                              standard library. Together
                                              with Traian, the overall
                                              performance has been
                                              improved for over at least
                                              1000x. The formula also
                                              changes quite a bit to
                                              separate the encoding of
                                              thread interleavings and
                                              that of race conditions.
                                              Not to mention there are
                                              countless

                                              why Toshiba would choose

We would only do that if the original access is atomic.  Otherwise we could
actually have a race.

The existing backend is optimized to work at word level and looks for
equality instead of interval intersection.  There was a proposal (Yilong's
I believe) to make it work with intervals specifically for C but that was
postponed because we were not sure how much to invest in RV Predict.

This is about right. RV-Predict[Bare-metal] also 1) makes some assumptions
to instrument less memory accesses and 2) relies on user annotations to
instrument interrupt-related operations.

Dave, have you got a chance to read the original PLDI paper on rv-predict?
The encoding of interrupt is very similar to the encoding of locks. Let O1
be the order variable of disabling an interrupt and O2 enabling an
interrupt IRQ1. Let O3 and O4 be the order variables of entering and
exiting the ISR of that interrupt. If there is no priority between
interrupts, the encoding is as simple as `O2 < O3 \/ O1 > O4`: it's
basically saying that the two sections should be disjoint. Adding priority
is also easy. Say you have O5 and O6 as the order variables of entering and
exiting a higher priority interrupt IRQ2. The extra constraint would be `O6
< O3 \/ O5 > O4 \/ O3 < O5 < O6 < O4`: IRQ2 may be serviced before IRQ1,
after IRQ1, or preempt the ISR of IRQ1.

As I said before, ideally, we will have one backend implemented in C++
which can handle traces generated by different front-ends. Of course, we
need to specialize the processing and encoding code for each type of
traces. But there will also be quite some shared code.

Guys, I am sorry for being so quiet.  I really wanted to stay involved with
this interesting discussion but I got distracted with urgent things at UIUC
and then I was not able to find the time to get back into the meat of this
discussion.  David, can you please send a wrap-up message summarizing this
thread and if there is anything where I can help right now?

Thanks,
Grigore

Where the RV-Predict[C] runtime intercepts fork(2) with the help of
ThreadSanitizer's interceptor,

	 TSAN_INTERCEPTOR(int, fork, int fake) {
	   if (cur_thread()->in_symbolizer)
	     return REAL(fork)(fake);
	   SCOPED_INTERCEPTOR_RAW(fork, fake);
	   ForkBefore(thr, pc);
	   int pid = REAL(fork)(fake);
	   if (pid == 0) {
	     // child
	     ForkChildAfter(thr, pc);
	     FdOnFork(thr, pc);
	   } else if (pid > 0) {
	     // parent
	     ForkParentAfter(thr, pc);
	+    RVFork(pid, pc);
	   } else {
	     // error
	     ForkParentAfter(thr, pc);
	   }
	   return pid;
	 }

I would hope to intercept fork(2) more simply:

	 RV_PREDICT_INTERCEPTOR(pid_t, fork, fake) {
	 	pid_t pid = REAL(fork)(fake);
	 	if (pid > 0)
	 		RVFork(pid, return_address(0));
	 	return pid;
	 }

I think that the existing ThreadSanitizer intercepts were used for
the sake of expedience?  Or is it necessary to use a lot of the
ThreadSanitizer runtime, and to make those Fork*After(thr, pc) calls?

I do not yet understand the purpose of calls like RVAcquire() and
RVRelease() sprinkled in the ThreadSanitizer runtime.  They seem to log
loads and stores rather than lock acquire/release.  Maybe someone can
explain faster than I can reverse-engineer it.

Dave,

As far as I remember, RVAcquire and RVRelease are used to record atomic
accesses to objects representing attemptings file descriptors and locks.
They were useful in detecting race conditions on those objects between
operations like acquire/release and delete/destroy.

You were clear. I didn't read carefully enough. When I saw thread-local
buffer earlier, I immediately jumped to the conclusion that no one else
could touch this buffer. We should just call them per-thread buffers to
avoid confusion.

Correct.

That's perfectly fine as long as, like you said, the `acquire` from another
thread doesn't appear in the former window.

No, at least not in RV-Predict[Java]. Whenever you see a unpaired
`acquire`/`release`, you can infer that there must be a `release`/`acquire`
appearing after/before the current window. That is all you need to
correctly build the formula.

I am very glad that you have started thinking about this problem. Before
proceeding to the concrete discussion of the algorithm, I just want to
mention a few goals I have in mind. Note that they may not be consistent
with each other.

* less memory barriers
* zero-copy of events between the frontend and the backend: for instance,
we can have multiple ring buffers per thread and a globally shared buffer
index that specifies the current buffer; we advance the buffer index for
each window to avoid copying the events in the buffer.
* parallelizing the analysis of each backend: unlike TSan, our analysis is
trivially highly scalable; this may allow us to match the performance of
TSan on a many-core machine
* no heavy writes on shared variable
* avoid blocking app threads because of the backend

I haven't understand the usage of "generation" up till this point but I
have two comments:
1) perhaps "epoch" is a more commonly used term for this kind of stuff?
2) `gen(e1) < gen(e2) => e1 <hb e2` doesn't look right, I guess you meant
`gen(e1) < gen(e2) => not (e2 <hb e1)`?

Sure, you can order the logging to ensure that property. Though I think it
looks better to move the code for logging `cog` before `log(store(x, v))`
for the sake of consistency.

During my flight back from OSDI, I got some time to flesh out an algorithm
that is quite simple and seems to achieve all of my goals above.

* Each app thread will have a number of ring buffers used for storing
events. Having multiple ring buffers per thread can be used to achieve
zero-copy of events between the frontend and the backend. The number of
ring buffers should be configured based on how fast the backend can process
the trace window such that event logging will not be blocked by the backend
(suppose you have a lot of cores to spare).
* There is a global atomic variable `bufferIdx` specifying the current ring
buffer in use. Each thread will need to read this variable
(`bufferIdx.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`) to determine before logging
each event to decide which ring buffer to use.
* Each slot in the ring buffer has an atomic flag `valid` indicating
whether the slot contains a valid event. The flag is set to `1` after
writing an event. Of course, setting the flag must be a release operation:
`valid.store(1, std::memory_order_release)`. A straw-man alternative would
be to use an atomic variable `count` to record the number of events in the
buffer. But that would require frequent `fetch_add` (
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add) on the variable
`count`.
* There is also a global atomic integer `eventCounter` that every app
thread must increment after logging an event (this seems expensive but I
will explain how to optimize it later). The increment on this event counter
can be relaxed operation: we don't need this variable for synchronization,
all we want is atomicity. If `eventCounter.fetch_add(1,
std::memory_order_relaxed) % WINDOW_SIZE == 0`, the calling thread is
responsible for calling `bufferIdx.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed`
that marks the beginning of a new window. An RVP backend thread must also
be triggered to start working on previous window.
* The first job of an RVP backend thread is to identify how many events are
logged in each app thread's old ring buffer. It does so by iterating over
the ring buffer and finds the first slot whose `valid` flag is 0. The
sublety here is that when the RVP thread tries to count the number of
events, the app thread may not yet see the updated `bufferIdx` value and
still logs to it. Even though we have used `valid` flag in each slot to
sync the reader and the writer, it's possible that we miss some events at
the end of the window. In particular, it's possible to have two events e1
and e2 in thread 1 and thread 2, respectively, such that 1) e1 <hb e2; 2)
thread 1 is scanned by the RVP thread before thread 2; 3) the RVP thread
sees e2 but not e1. Missing e1 but not e2 would invalidate our model built
in the backend. Fortunately, the solution is simple: just loop over all the
app threads until no new events are discovered by the RVP thread. (Proof of
correctness omitted)

To summarize, the above algorithm achieves:
* zero-copy of events
* overhead of logging each event = one relaxed read on `bufferIdx` + one
release write on `valid` + one relaxed inc on `eventCounter`
* overhead of logging per window = one relaxed inc on `bufferIdx`
* almost zero contention on `bufferIdx` or `valid`

Obviously, the most expensive part of this algorithm is the relaxed inc on
`eventCounter` as it's heavily contended. As an optimization, we can reduce
the contention and amortize the cost of relaxed inc by only updating the
`eventCounter` every K events. We can prove the correctness of the
algorithm in the same way. The only effect of batch updating of
`eventCounter` is that the resulting window size could be larger than the
configured threshold (`WINDOW_SIZE`). The upper bound of the window size
now becomes `WINDOW_SIZE + K * #threads`.

I am quite satisfied about this algorithm. Not just because the overhead of
logging each event is close to the theoretical lower bound (i.e., you must
have at least one release operation for synchronization since the buffers
are not (and cannot be) thread-local) but also because it's relatively
simple to reason about.

ere is a global atomic variable `bufferIdx` specifying the current ring buf=

 which ring buffer to use.</div><div>* Each slot in the ring buffer has an =
atomic flag `valid` indicating whether the slot contains a valid event. The=
 flag is set to `1` after writing an event. Of course, setting the flag mus=
t be a release operation: `valid.store(1, std::memory_order_release)`. A st=
raw-man alternative would be to use an atomic variable `count` to record th=
e number of events in the buffer. But that would require frequent `fetch_ad=
d` (<a href=3D"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add">ht=
tp://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add</a>) on the variable=
 `count`.</div><div>* There is also a global atomic integer `eventCounter` =
that every app thread must increment after logging an event (this seems exp=
ensive but I will explain how to optimize it later). The increment on this =
event counter can be relaxed operation: we don&#39;t need this variable for=
 synchronization, all we want is atomicity. If `eventCounter.fetch_add(1, s=

triggered to start working on previous window.</div><div>* The first job of=
 an RVP backend thread is to identify how many events are logged in each ap=
p thread&#39;s old ring buffer. It does so by iterating over the ring buffe=
r and finds the first slot whose `valid` flag is 0. The sublety here is tha=
t when the RVP thread tries to count the number of events, the app thread m=
ay not yet see the updated `bufferIdx` value and still logs to it. Even tho=
ugh we have used `valid` flag in each slot to sync the reader and the write=
r, it&#39;s possible that we miss some events at the end of the window. In =
particular, it&#39;s possible to have two events e1 and e2 in thread 1 and =
thread 2, respectively, such that 1) e1 &lt;hb e2; 2) thread 1 is scanned b=
y the RVP thread before thread 2; 3) the RVP thread sees e2 but not e1. Mis=
sing e1 but not e2 would invalidate our model built in the backend. Fortuna=
tely, the solution is simple: just loop over all the app threads until no n=

A global generation counter, ggen, will tell the current generation<br>

a change-of-generation (cog) event, cog(lgen).=C2=A0 Between event cog(lgen=

load/store event is bracketed by the correct cog events.=C2=A0 Given a load=

I have not decided for certain how wide I will make the generation<br>
counters, or how I will deal with wraparound.<br>
<br>
A new generation is begun by atomically increasing mem[ggen].<br>

generation(e2) when e2 happens before e1, I would like to hear about it.<br=
></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Sure, you can order the logging to ensure=
 that property. Though I think it looks better to move the code for logging=
 `cog` before `log(store(x, v))` for the sake of consistency.</div><div><br=
></div><div>During my flight back from OSDI, I got some time to flesh out a=
n algorithm that is quite simple and seems to achieve all of my goals above=
.</div><div><br></div><div>* Each app thread will have a number of ring buf=
fers used for storing events. Having multiple ring buffers per thread can b=
e used to achieve zero-copy of events between the frontend and the backend.=
 The number of ring buffers should be configured based on how fast the back=
end can process the trace window such that event logging will not be blocke=
d by the backend (suppose you have a lot of cores to spare).</div><div>* Th=
ere is a global atomic variable `bufferIdx` specifying the current ring buf=
fer in use. Each thread will need to read this variable (`bufferIdx.load(st=
d::memory_<wbr>order_relaxed)`) to determine before logging each event to d=
ecide which ring buffer to use.</div><div>* Each slot in the ring buffer ha=
s an atomic flag `valid` indicating whether the slot contains a valid event=
. The flag is set to `1` after writing an event. Of course, setting the fla=
g must be a release operation: `valid.store(1, std::memory_order_release)`.=
 A straw-man alternative would be to use an atomic variable `count` to reco=
rd the number of events in the buffer. But that would require frequent `fet=
ch_add` (<a href=3D"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_ad=
d" target=3D"_blank">http://en.cppreference.com/w/<wbr>cpp/atomic/atomic/fe=
tch_add</a>) on the variable `count`.</div><div>* There is also a global at=
omic integer `eventCounter` that every app thread must increment after logg=
ing an event (this seems expensive but I will explain how to optimize it la=
ter). The increment on this event counter can be relaxed operation: we don&=
#39;t need this variable for synchronization, all we want is atomicity. If =
`eventCounter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed) % WINDOW_SIZE =3D=3D =
0`, the calling thread is responsible for calling `bufferIdx.fetch_add(1, s=
td::memory_order_relaxed` that marks the beginning of a new window. An RVP =
backend thread must also be triggered to start working on previous window.<=
/div><div>* The first job of an RVP backend thread is to identify how many =
events are logged in each app thread&#39;s old ring buffer. It does so by i=
terating over the ring buffer and finds the first slot whose `valid` flag i=
s 0. The sublety here is that when the RVP thread tries to count the number=
 of events, the app thread may not yet see the updated `bufferIdx` value an=
d still logs to it. Even though we have used `valid` flag in each slot to s=
ync the reader and the writer, it&#39;s possible that we miss some events a=
t the end of the window. In particular, it&#39;s possible to have two event=
s e1 and e2 in thread 1 and thread 2, respectively, such that 1) e1 &lt;hb =
e2; 2) thread 1 is scanned by the RVP thread before thread 2; 3) the RVP th=
read sees e2 but not e1. Missing e1 but not e2 would invalidate our model b=
uilt in the backend. Fortunately, the solution is simple: just loop over al=
l the app threads until no new events are discovered by the RVP thread. (Pr=
oof of correctness omitted)</div><div><br></div><div>To summarize, the abov=
e algorithm achieves:</div><div>* zero-copy of events</div><div>* overhead =
of logging each event =3D one relaxed read on `bufferIdx` + one release wri=
te on `valid` + one relaxed inc on `eventCounter`</div><div>* overhead of l=
ogging per window =3D one relaxed inc on `bufferIdx`</div><div>* almost zer=
o contention on `bufferIdx` or `valid`</div><div><br></div><div>Obviously, =
the most expensive part of this algorithm is the relaxed inc on `eventCount=
er` as it&#39;s heavily contended. As an optimization, we can reduce the co=
ntention and amortize the cost of relaxed inc by only updating the `eventCo=
unter` every K events. We can prove the correctness of the algorithm in the=
 same way. The only effect of batch updating of `eventCounter` is that the =
resulting window size could be larger than the configured threshold (`WINDO=
W_SIZE`). The upper bound of the window size now becomes `WINDOW_SIZE + K *=
 #threads`.</div><div><br></div><div>I am quite satisfied about this algori=
thm. Not just because the overhead of logging each event is close to the th=
eoretical lower bound (i.e., you must have at least one release operation f=
or synchronization since the buffers are not (and cannot be) thread-local) =
but also because it&#39;s relatively simple to reason about.</div><div><br>=

I'm trying to catch up with this discussion; sorry for jumping in the
middle of it without reading the subsequent messages, but
I just want to let you know that Jeff Huang (former postdoc in our group)
has developed these techniques to do thread-local
logging.  I think one of the papers where it is described is here:
http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/FSL/papers/2015/huang-luo-rosu-2015-icse/huang-luo-rosu-2015-icse-public.pdf
But I am sure that he must have used it in subsequent papers.  I can ask
him if this is still relevant.

Here&#39;s my current idea of the event-logging subsystem:<br>
<br>
### Definitions<br>
<br>
application thread: a thread that runs the application code.=C2=A0 Every<br=
>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 system-under-test (SUT) has at least one application thread.<=

<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 application thread calls to record event `e` on a thread-loca=
l<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 ring buffer.<br>
<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 from per-thread ring buffers to the backend.=C2=A0 The transm=
ission<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 procedure may run in a dedicated thread; then we say that the=

ssion procedure may<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 run on an application thread during its log_event(e) calls; t=
hen we<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 say that it&#39;s a &quot;synchronous transmission procedure.=
&quot;<br>
<br>
send function: the transmission procedure calls the send function to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 send buffers to the backend.=C2=A0 The customer may provide t=
he send<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 function.=C2=A0 Send functions may be blocking or nonblocking=
.<br>
<br>
### Operation<br>
<br>
An application thread calls log_event(e) to log an events on a<br>
thread-local ring buffer.=C2=A0 The ring buffer has one writer, the thread<=
br>
that it belongs to, and it has one reader, the transmission procedure,<br>
so it&#39;s possible to use the lock-free single-writer/single-reader queue=
<br>
pattern here.<br>
<br>
When a thread finds that its ring buffer is half full, then it will<br>
invoke the transmission procedure by waking the transmission thread or,<br>
on a SUT having no transmission thread, by performing the transmission<br>
procedure itself.=C2=A0 So that no two application threads perform the<br>
transmission procedure simultaneously, application threads will<br>
coordinate through some suitable synchronization mechanism.<br>
<br>
If an application thread finds that its ring buffer is critically full<br>
after it logs an event, then it will set the Pause flag indicating that<br>
all application threads should stop, and then block until the flag<br>
clears.=C2=A0 As each other application thread enters log_event(e), it will=
<br>
also check the Pause flag and block if it is set.<br>

The transmission procedure passes the I/O vectors collected from<br>
all of the ring buffers to the send function, which initiates<br>
transmission to the backend.<br>
<br>
Send functions come in two varieties, blocking and nonblocking.<br>
If the transmission procedure runs on an application thread, then<br>
before it calls a blocking send function, it sets the Pause flag<br>
to tell all application threads to pause.<br>
<br>
If the transmission procedure runs on a dedicated thread, then it will<br>
not set the Pause flag, regardless of whether or not the send function<br>
blocks.<br>
<br>
If the send function does not block, then the transmission procedure<br>
will not set the Pause flag.<br>
<br>
If the send function does block, then the transmission procedure<br>
expects for it to return either how many bytes were sent, or an error<br>
indication.=C2=A0 If the send function does not block, the transmission<br>
procedure will expect to be notified asynchronously of the transmission<br>
length/status.=C2=A0 For example, there may be an interrupt when the<br>
length/status is ready.<br>
<br>
After a successful transmission, the transmission procedure advances<br>
its pointer on each ring buffer and clears the Pause flag.<br>
<br>
Regarding the Pause flag, I gave my thinking in a previous email<br>
(Subject: RV-Predict[C] implementation thoughts):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The idea here is to keep some threads from paus=

On architectures like ARM, an unaligned load or store may<br>

An C compiler may generate four byte-sized accesses for ARM to load or<br>

(Incidentally, looks like RV-Match detects unaligned loads and stores.<br>

The GPredict paper talks about building formula based on "thread-local
traces" instead of "one global trace". This is no news to us. We have been
doing this in RV-Predict[Java] for a long time. How to do thread-local
logging is the interesting and hard part. Obviously, with the window
strategy, there cannot be 100% thread-local logging because at the end of
each window one thread has to somehow collect all the per-thread traces.
The gist of my proposal is that we can approximate thread-local logging via
batching plus really lightweight synchronization. The only downside is that
each window is not precisely limited by the window size we configure.
Intuitively, the more events we batch in each thread, the larger upper
bound we have for the window size.

With thread-local logging, I have an immature conjecture: it's possible for
RV-Predict to match the performance of TSan (maybe even faster) if we could
efficiently parallelize/distribute the analysis of each window.

Here&#39;s my current idea of the event-logging subsystem:<br>
<br>
### Definitions<br>
<br>
application thread: a thread that runs the application code.=C2=A0 Every<br=
>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 system-under-test (SUT) has at least one application thread.<=

<br>
log_event(e): an abstract procedure that the instrumentation on an<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 application thread calls to record event `e` on a thread-loca=
l<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 ring buffer.<br>
<br>
transmission procedure: the procedure that empties application events<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 from per-thread ring buffers to the backend.=C2=A0 The transm=
ission<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 procedure may run in a dedicated thread; then we say that the=
re&#39;s<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 an &quot;asynchronous transmission procedure,&quot; and it ru=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 called the &quot;transmission thread.&quot;=C2=A0 The transmi=
ssion procedure may<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 run on an application thread during its log_event(e) calls; t=
hen we<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 say that it&#39;s a &quot;synchronous transmission procedure.=
&quot;<br>
<br>
send function: the transmission procedure calls the send function to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 send buffers to the backend.=C2=A0 The customer may provide t=
he send<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 function.=C2=A0 Send functions may be blocking or nonblocking=
.<br>
<br>
### Operation<br>
<br>
An application thread calls log_event(e) to log an events on a<br>
thread-local ring buffer.=C2=A0 The ring buffer has one writer, the thread<=
br>
that it belongs to, and it has one reader, the transmission procedure,<br>
so it&#39;s possible to use the lock-free single-writer/single-reader queue=
<br>
pattern here.<br>
<br>
When a thread finds that its ring buffer is half full, then it will<br>
invoke the transmission procedure by waking the transmission thread or,<br>
on a SUT having no transmission thread, by performing the transmission<br>
procedure itself.=C2=A0 So that no two application threads perform the<br>
transmission procedure simultaneously, application threads will<br>
coordinate through some suitable synchronization mechanism.<br>
<br>
If an application thread finds that its ring buffer is critically full<br>
after it logs an event, then it will set the Pause flag indicating that<br>
all application threads should stop, and then block until the flag<br>
clears.=C2=A0 As each other application thread enters log_event(e), it will=
<br>
also check the Pause flag and block if it is set.<br>
<br>
Whenever the transmission procedure is invoked, it examines the ring<br>
buffer belonging to each thread, and if it is non-empty, constructs I/O<br>
vectors (void *buf, size_t buflen) for it.=C2=A0 The first I/O vector point=
s<br>
to a change-of-thread indication.=C2=A0 If the ring-buffer events belonging=
<br>
to the transmission thread don&#39;t wrap, then the second I/O vector point=

The transmission procedure passes the I/O vectors collected from<br>
all of the ring buffers to the send function, which initiates<br>
transmission to the backend.<br>
<br>
Send functions come in two varieties, blocking and nonblocking.<br>
If the transmission procedure runs on an application thread, then<br>
before it calls a blocking send function, it sets the Pause flag<br>
to tell all application threads to pause.<br>
<br>
If the transmission procedure runs on a dedicated thread, then it will<br>
not set the Pause flag, regardless of whether or not the send function<br>
blocks.<br>
<br>
If the send function does not block, then the transmission procedure<br>
will not set the Pause flag.<br>
<br>
If the send function does block, then the transmission procedure<br>
expects for it to return either how many bytes were sent, or an error<br>
indication.=C2=A0 If the send function does not block, the transmission<br>
procedure will expect to be notified asynchronously of the transmission<br>
length/status.=C2=A0 For example, there may be an interrupt when the<br>
length/status is ready.<br>
<br>
After a successful transmission, the transmission procedure advances<br>
its pointer on each ring buffer and clears the Pause flag.<br>
<br>
Regarding the Pause flag, I gave my thinking in a previous email<br>
(Subject: RV-Predict[C] implementation thoughts):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The idea here is to keep some threads from paus=

On architectures like ARM, an unaligned load or store may<br>

An C compiler may generate four byte-sized accesses for ARM to load or<br>

Grigore,

Just to expand on what Yilong was saying: it's fairly easy to produce
thread-local trace logs.  Stitching together N free-running threads'
traces into a self-consistent window, however, is a bit tricky.  If
you don't want to pause all application threads in order to establish
a window boundary, then you have to mark the boundary somehow on the
thread-local trace log.  As Yilong points out, you have to mark the
boundaries with care, so that a store on thread P does not appear in a
later window than a dependent load on thread Q.  Between the two of us,
Yilong and I have a couple of schemes for handling this.

Dave

I got the symbol name and size to appear by building with GCC and
enabling libbacktrace:

        cmake ../rv-predict-compiler-rt/
        -DLLVM_DIR=$HOME/clang+llvm-3.8.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/share/llvm/cmake
        -DLLVM_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/clang+llvm-3.8.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/bin/llvm-config
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DSANITIZER_LIBBACKTRACE=1
        -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/include/" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++

Traian, do you think that is how you got the symbol names to appear,
previously?

Dwight and I were talking about how to produce symbol names from
data/instruction addresses.  Our hunch is that we should be able to
use the DWARF debugging information to turn addresses to symbols
for instructions, global and local data.  It would be nice to do it
off-line, too, of course.  I'm vaguely aware of a library, libdwarf,
that may work for this purpose.  I will find out more.

Traian set my straight on Google Hangouts: the way to get the symbol
names to appear, without changing compiler (clang->gcc) or linking in
libbacktrace, is to make sure llvm-symbolizer is on your path.  On
rvwork-1, I added $HOME/bin/ to $PATH and made a symbolic link from
$HOME/bin/ to /usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer-3.8.

For C programs, RV-Predict produces output like it does in the Vagrant VM.

For C++ programs, the output is quite a bit different from the output
in the Vagrant VM.  The paths are all absolute in my output, and in my
output it looks like library functions are included in the stack traces
where they are omitted in the VM.  Does this look familiar?

If that is the case, then it is probably best for Grigore to use the
version that is already on the website.

At this point, the only advantage to the version that I am working on is
that you don't have to build all of LLVM.  It has the disadvantage that
the stack traces for deadlocks *still* look worse than the traces in
the existing Vagrant VM!  I found out late yesterday afternoon, after I
had successfully suppressed library calls in the stack backtraces, that
some frames are appear two or more times, like stack::top() stack.cpp:18
does:

Data race on stack memory created by thread 0 at 0x7ffd06e93da0: {{{
    Concurrent read in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at stack::top() stack.cpp:18
        at stack::top() stack.cpp:18
        at stack::top() stack.cpp:18
    T3 is created by T1
        at main stack.cpp:66

    Concurrent write in thread T2 (locks held: {WriteLock@25})

Was the Vagrant VM for RV-Predict produced from particular branches of
rv-predict-llvm and rv-predict-compiler-rt and rv-predict?  Where can I
find the sources for the Vagrant VMs?

On Friday I was pretty sure that I had found the revisions for
rv-predict, rv-predict-llvm, and -compiler-rt that were used to make the
Vagrant VMs.  I went by the date on rv-predict-c.tar.gz, which was 19
Mar 2016 in one VM, and 23 Mar 2016 in another.

When I experimented a bit, I found that the runtime emitted errors
concerning address->symbol conversion when I compiled and ran
rv-predict-c/examples/demo/stack.cpp .

I traced those errors down to a bug in
__sanitizer::SymbolizerProcess::ReadFromSymbolizer in
lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_symbolizer_process_libcdep.cc: it tries
to read(2) output records from llvm-symbolizer into a 16kB buffer.  If
the buffer is too small to hold an entire record, then the buffer will
be exhausted.  ReadFromSymbolizer will try to read(fd, buffer, 0) and
misinterpret the return value of 0 as EOF.  Then it gripes and restarts
llvm-symbolizer.

Today I figured out the reason that I am seeing the bug in my tests on
rvwork-1, but I do not see it on the VM: I accidentally compiled with
optimization (-O2), so llvm-symbolizer was emitting lengthy stacks of
inlined frames.  The scripts on the VM did not enable optimization.  Now
that I've disabled optimization, I get results that resemble the Vagrant
VM's.  Actually, they look a little bit better.  So that's progress.

I need to think more about what to do next, but I think that a sensible
step for tomorrow is to write down how to reproduce my current results,
and then to re-read and summarize all of the various RV-Predict
discussion threads.

Today, Dwight and I were talking about the problems of overriding
function calls in an application under test.  We were especially
interested in cases that crop up in the DENSO unit tests that use the
Parasoft C++Test framework.

In C++Test, a user can provide for any function `f` a stub
implementation called `CppTest_Stub_f`.  C++Test will replace the
application's implementation with the stub implementation.  It's a bit
tricky to implement these overrides purely using the C preprocessor
or the linker.  C++Test appears to heavily rewrite the source code.

I had hoped that we could use the linker, but Dwight pointed out that
sometimes an application function is called in the same compilation
unit as it is defined in.  In that case, the symbol in the call may be
resolved by the compiler/assembler, so the linker won't have a chance to
provide an alternative.  So it appears to be necessary to rewrite the
program some.

I thought that we could make an LLVM pass that identified the site
of each function call, groveled in the debug info to find the
file:line:column where the call appeared, and emitted the name of the
function and its file:line:column so that we could rewrite a call site:

	BEFORE

123	f(...);

	AFTER

123	#define f CppTest_Stub_f
124	#line 123
125	f(...);
126	#undef f
127	#line 124

Dwight told me that we could get the same information through the
clang frontend (libtooling).  That's nice because it skips the bitcode
generation.  Also, Dwight suggested rewriting the function definitions
instead of the call sites:

	BEFORE

123	void
124	f(...)
125	{
126		...
127	}

	AFTER

1	#define f CppTest_Stub_f
2	#line 1
.
.
.
123	#undef f 
124	#line 123
125	void
126	f(...)
127	#define	f CppTest_Stub_f
128	#line 125
129	{
130		...
131	}

One of us (probably me) will write a pre-preprocessor that does that,
soon.  Writing this pre-preprocessor will save us from having to produce
an independent solution for RV-Match and for RV-Predict.

For DENSO, we are supposed to design a report format that is easy for
their engineers to use, so today I am looking at our existing format
and thinking of changes that help a developer to zero-in on data races.
Below, I'm basically transcribing my thought process as I modify one of
the reports that RV-Predict[C] produces, today.

`lpcq` is a program that I added to rv-predict-c/examples/demo/ that
manipulates a linked producer-consumer queue in a racy way unless you
enable locking by passing the -l option.  Here is some RV-Predict output
for `lpcq`:

$ rv-predict-execute ./lpcq
read item 0
read item 1
read item 2
read item 3
read item 4
Data race on array element #10: {{{
    Concurrent write in thread T2 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    T2 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

That's not all of the output.  See the attachment for the rest.

First, let's make the display less optically busy, be concise, and omit
empty lock sets:

Data race on array element #10:
    Concurrent write in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

IIUC, "Data race on array element #n" is the fallback message that
RV-Predict uses when it does not recognize a memory location as
belonging to a particular object on the heap or a stack.

When I ask myself why RV-Predict does not recognize the location, it's
only necessary to describe the location in words to understand the
difficulty: at that location is the first member, `head`, of local
lpcq_t-type variable `q` in `main` on T1's stack.  Whew.

If we were going to give a name to that location by referring only to
the program's debug information and to an event log, then we would need
for the log to tell us the new frame pointer when we entered main on
thread T1.  (Cue a revision to the event-log specification!)  We'd scan
all threads' stacks for one that enclosed the location, then walk the
stack we found to find a frame that held the location, then use the
frame pointer and location with the debug information to produce a name.

I think that in principle, we can rewrite the report above to refer
to q.head by name:

Data race on local variable `q.head`:
    Concurrent write in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Local variable `q` of type `lpcq_t` in thread 1
     >  at main lpcq_main.c:100

Since load/store traces record values as well as memory locations, we
may as well report those, too.  In this case, the values are pointers,
so we can give them a name.  For the sake of example, I will take an
educated guess about the names:

Data race on local variable `q.head`:
    Write &items[0] -> q.head in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Write &items[1] -> q.head in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Local variable `q` of type `lpcq_t` in thread 1
     >  at main lpcq_main.c:100

    Global variable `items` of type `item_t[5]` at lpcq_main.c:22

Let's transform another record.  This one involves a load concurrent
with a store on q.tailp:

Data race on array element #14: {{{
    Concurrent read in thread T2 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:28
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    T2 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:50
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

Transformed:

Data race on local variable `q.tailp`:
    Read &items[0].next <- q.tailp in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:28
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Write q.tailp <- &items[1].next in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:50
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Local variable `q` of type `lpcq_t` in thread 1
     >  at main lpcq_main.c:100

    Global variable `items` of type `item_t[5]` at lpcq_main.c:22

I may misunderstand this report:

Data race on global 'items' of size 80 at 0x000001481200 (lpcq + 0x000001481210): {{{
    Concurrent read in thread T2 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    T2 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

Here is my transformation:

Data race on global `items[1].next`:
    Read &items[2].next <- items[1].next in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Write items[1].next <- &items[2].next in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Global variable `items` of type `item_t[5]` at lpcq_main.c:22

I'd like to have your feedback before I go too much farther down this
path.

It's hard for me to know exactly how these reports will look to the users
without having the source for this project in front of me. And in fact, one
of the things that DENSO says they want is for us to have reports that show
the source and highlight lines that contain errors in red or something. So
it seems like this might be a good start in refining information we provide
about the errors themselves, but more thought needs to go into the design
of the interface as a whole.

Also, our deliverable just says we need a mockup for this deliverable
cycle, so I would take what you have so far and incorporate it somehow into
a sample HTML user interface like I described. This is lower priority than
the stuff with the stubs though...

IIUC, &quot;Data race on array element #n&quot; is the fallback message tha=
t<br>
RV-Predict uses when it does not recognize a memory location as<br>
belonging to a particular object on the heap or a stack.<br>
<br>
When I ask myself why RV-Predict does not recognize the location, it&#39;s<=
br>
only necessary to describe the location in words to understand the<br>
difficulty: at that location is the first member, `head`, of local<br>
lpcq_t-type variable `q` in `main` on T1&#39;s stack.=C2=A0 Whew.<br>
<br>
If we were going to give a name to that location by referring only to<br>
the program&#39;s debug information and to an event log, then we would need=
<br>
for the log to tell us the new frame pointer when we entered main on<br>
thread T1.=C2=A0 (Cue a revision to the event-log specification!)=C2=A0 We&=
#39;d scan<br>
all threads&#39; stacks for one that enclosed the location, then walk the<b=
r>
stack we found to find a frame that held the location, then use the<br>
frame pointer and location with the debug information to produce a name.<br=
>
<br>
I think that in principle, we can rewrite the report above to refer<br>
to q.head by name:<br>

Dwight,

(Oops, this time with the attachments.)

Thanks for your feedback.  I will add something to my mockup that shows
the source lines that are involved.  I would like to put off writing any
HTML until we have a better idea of the layout.  I haven't forgotten
about the stubs.

Looking at the contract, we have the latitude to explore many styles of
interface.  We could conceivably incorporate a graphic, such as a ladder
diagram, with each report.  I have attached a couple of sketches.  The
first sketch shows a ladder diagram for this data race:

q.head (memory) is on the center rail, threads 2 and 3 are on the side
rails, and "rungs" from thread 2 to q.head and thread 3 to q.head
indicate stores.  The rung from thread 2 to q.head is bifurcated to
indicate that the order is a toss-up.  Each rung is labeled with the
value that was stored.

The second sketch shows a couple of additional ideas.  First, I show
some context: loads and stores leading up to the race condition.  Next,
the center rail becomes a plane "perpendicular" to the plane of the
sketch, representing all of memory.  On the plane of memory there are
rails for the locations involved in the race and its context: q.tailp
and q.head.

I'm just spitballing here, but I think a graphic could be very
illuminating.

These sketches are cheap to make and to throw away.  So are the
plain-text mockups.  So we should keep iterating, and involve DENSO in
the iteration pretty soon.

I welcome additional feedback.

Dave

I think a ladder diagram sounds good, but it's possible it may be perceived
as too visually noisy by the folks at DENSO. I think we should try to make
a diagram that looks as neat as possible, maybe with some kind of online
diagamming tool, and then email it to the guys at DENSO and see what they
think of it.

Dave,

I like your suggested improvements on the existing 2-stacktrace format. As
for the ladder graph, I believe it will be a super important advantage of
RV-Predict over TSan. I used to evaluate RV-Predict[Java] against Eclipse
and Tomcat. It's really painful and time-consuming to validate the race
report just by looking at the two stacktraces. As for TSan, it would be
very hard (if not impossible) for them to generate something alike based on

I will write something up about the stack-trace format and send it to
DENSO.  If anyone else has any feedback, do let me know.

I am glad to hear that the ladder diagram is hard for the competition to
produce.  I will make more detailed sketches to discuss.

BTW, I think high-DPI and 4k displays present thrilling opportunities
for visualizing program behavior.

I would suggest not to spend too much time on the ladder diagram for now. A
simple thread-interleaving diagram would be good enough from my
perspective. It's already a huge improvement over the 2-stacktrace report.

This email is a repeat of one I sent earlier this week, only I have
added source code to some of the reports for context.

***
***

For DENSO, we are supposed to design a report format that is easy for
their engineers to use, so today I am looking at our existing format
and thinking of changes that help a developer to zero-in on data races.
Below, I'm basically transcribing my thought process as I modify one of
the reports that RV-Predict[C] produces, today.

`lpcq` is a program that I added to rv-predict-c/examples/demo/ that
manipulates a linked producer-consumer queue in a racy way unless you
enable locking by passing the -l option.  Here is some RV-Predict output
for `lpcq`:

$ rv-predict-execute ./lpcq
read item 0
read item 1
read item 2
read item 3
read item 4
Data race on array element #10: {{{
    Concurrent write in thread T2 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    T2 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

That's not all of the output.  See the attachment for the rest.

First, let's make the display less optically busy, be concise, and omit
empty lock sets:

Data race on array element #10:
    Concurrent write in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

IIUC, "Data race on array element #n" is the fallback message that
RV-Predict uses when it does not recognize a memory location as
belonging to a particular object on the heap or a stack.

When I ask myself why RV-Predict does not recognize the location, it's
only necessary to describe the location in words to understand the
difficulty: at that location is the first member, `head`, of local
lpcq_t-type variable `q` in `main` on T1's stack.  Whew.

If we were going to give a name to that location by referring only to
the program's debug information and to an event log, then we would need
for the log to tell us the new frame pointer when we entered main on
thread T1.  (Cue a revision to the event-log specification!)  We'd scan
all threads' stacks for one that enclosed the location, then walk the
stack we found to find a frame that held the location, then use the
frame pointer and location with the debug information to produce a name.

I think that in principle, we can rewrite the report above to refer
to q.head by name:

Data race on local variable `q.head`:
    Concurrent write in thread 2
     >  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread 3
     >  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Local variable `q` of type `lpcq_t` in thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:100

Since load/store traces record values as well as memory locations, we
may as well report those, too.  In this case, the values are pointers,
so we can give them a name.  For the sake of example, I will take an
educated guess about the names:

Data race on local variable `q.head`:
    Write &items[0] -> q.head in thread 2
        at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36
	  31          void *item;
	  32
	  33          item = q->head;
	  34
	  35          void * volatile *nextp = lpcq_nextp(q->nextofs, item);
	> 36          q->head = *nextp;
	  37          if (q->tailp == nextp) {
	  38                  q->tailp = &q->head;
	  39          }
	  40          return item;
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Write &items[1] -> q.head in thread 3
        at lpcq_put lpcq.c:51
	  46          void * volatile *nextp = lpcq_nextp(q->nextofs, item);
	  47
	  48          *nextp = NULL;
	  49          void * volatile *otailp = q->tailp;
	  50          q->tailp = nextp;
	> 51          *otailp = item;
	  52  }
	  53
	  54  lpcq_iter_t
	  55  lpcq_getall(lpcq_t *q)
	  56  {
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    Thread 3 created by thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122

    Local variable `q` of type `lpcq_t` in thread 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:100
	    99          int i, opt;
	 > 100          lpcq_t q;
	   101          pthread_mutex_t mutex;

    Global variable `items` of type `item_t[5]` at lpcq_main.c:22
	    21  pthread_mutex_t *mutexp = NULL;
	 >  22  item_t items[5];
	    23

Let's transform another record.  This one involves a load concurrent
with a store on q.tailp:

Data race on array element #14: {{{
    Concurrent read in thread T2 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_get lpcq.c:28
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    T2 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Concurrent write in thread T3 (locks held: {})
 ---->  at lpcq_put lpcq.c:50
        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

Transformed:

Data race on local variable `q.tailp`:
    Read &items[0].next <- q.tailp in thread 2
        at lpcq_get lpcq.c:28
          23  void *
          24  lpcq_get(lpcq_t *q)
          25  {
          26          int n = 0;
          27  
        > 28          if (q->tailp == &q->head)
          29                  return NULL;
          30  
          31          void *item;
          32  
          33          item = q->head;
        at consume lpcq_main.c:62
    Thread 2 created by 1
        at main lpcq_main.c:121

    Write q.tailp <- &items[1].next in thread 3

	    23


I may misunderstand this report:

Data race on global 'items' of size 80 at 0x000001481200 (lpcq + 0x000001481210): {{{
    Concurrent read in thread T2 (locks held: {})

        at produce lpcq_main.c:83
    T3 is created by T1
        at main lpcq_main.c:122
}}}

Here is my transformation:

Data race on global `items[1].next`:
    Read &items[2].next <- items[1].next in thread 2
        at lpcq_get lpcq.c:36

I'd like to have your feedback before I go too much farther down this
path.

Hi all, 

In the PLDI'14 RV-Predict paper, there is some (oblique?) mention of dynamic tracing, and that got me curious about DTrace. At first blush, it sounds like the required trace events could be generated by DTrace, without requiring source modifications (but capable of taking advantage of them), with minimal disruption to the normal runtime environment, and possibly including good-enough-for-production speed. These points alone would improve on, or even negate, a number of Parallocity's marketing points.

So I'd like to ask: has DTrace, or its Linux cousin eBPF, been considered as a trace source? 

I have tried looking for other RV.com papers in case the subject was mentioned anywhere else but I came up empty. I found however a paper in RV'16 named "Leveraging DTrace for Runtime Verification".

If DTrace is not well known I can try providing some explanation/example, I have some experience with it. As for eBPF, I am not familiar with it but I hear it is similar.

I am processing Aki's questions about interrupts, with the 78K0
manual in front of me.  It turns out that beside the static, default
priorities that are statically defined by the CPU (they are essentially
tie-breaking priorities), a maskable interrupt can be programmed to
use "high" or "low" priority, and DENSO's tests actually program those
priorities.  So that is something else to consider as we work on
RV-Predict for Interrupts.

Also, Aki mentioned in a previous meeting that interrupts
auto-disable---the service routine has to call EI() to re-enable
interrupts.  Looking at the code, however, it seems that that may be
true for some interrupts, but not for others.  I will have to dig deeper
into the manual to figure it out.

I think that we will have to manage Aki's expectations carefully.  As
Dwight said in our stand-up meeting, rather than producing a thorough
simulation of any MPU's interrupt machinery, maybe we can just provide
an API for customers to produce their own simulation of interrupts.
That seems reasonable to me.

Dave

Essentially I'm proposing for RV-Predict to have some kind of configuration
file that users have to write which provides all the relevant details of
how interrupts work on their MPU. It could be as simple as having them
write a function that decides which interrupt to invoke and when and
invokes it, or as complex as trying to model all the possible valiables
that may affect how interrupts are allowed to preempt and store them in
some kind of key value store in the file that the rv predict implementation
reads. I don't know exactly, I just know we can't provide a solution that
is dependent on the specific details of one specific MPU unless all of that
detail is abstracted away somehow and provided by the user when they
configure RV-Predict for their device.

Traian,

Grigore thinks that I should mine your RV-Predict for C for ideas and
possibly for code.  He means the one that is based on distributing a
custom LLVM.  Is there something like a Design & Implementation guide
for it?  Or can you give me an overview?

I have been working on the RV-Predict for bare metal, but Grigore thinks
that since RV-Predict for C was able to work with the Java backend, we
can use it to produce an end-to-end implementation that uses passes,
sooner.

I am especially keen on knowing where instrumentation was injected by
the whole-LLVM-based version, so that I can replicate that ASAP in
the bare-metal pass.

I would like to get a handle on the differences between the front-end of
RV-Predict[C] and the front-end of RV-Predict[Bare-metal].  Previously,
I felt pretty sure that they inserted a similar sort of instrumentation,
only RV-Predict[C] inserted more instrumentation, and for some reason
(maybe simple expediency) it put roots into LLVM.

I thought that the front-end of RV-Predict[C] already worked with
the backend?  In fact, I was pretty sure that I was using the
front-end and back-end when I compiled and ran some examples with
rv-predict-c-compile, etc.  What have I missed?

For comparison, RV-Predict[Bare-metal] works with no extant backend.

Let us start a conversation about the encoding of interrupts.  Please,
can you describe the interrupts encoding on all@ ? I have not produced
an encoding for RV-Predict before, so this will be educational for me.

I feel uneasy with the idea of producing two backends in two different
languages with orthogonal feature sets.  At first glance, they are
parallel lines: they will never meet.  And yet, we would like someday to
have a backend that supports multi-threading and interrupts.

Traian,

I have some questions to add to Yilong's.

When you expand a 64-bit access into eight byte-sized sub-accesses, do
you surround the sub-accesses in acquire/release?  It seems like that
would be necessary to prevent spurious races.

Is there any reason that the existing backend should not abstract
over Java and C memory models?  It seems like the kinds of memory
accesses that are possible in C are a strict superset of the Java
accesses.  It seems like we can always represent each memory access as
an operation and a byte interval, (op, [start, start + length - 1]).
Any two operations that involve overlapping byte intervals could be
involved in a race.

I'm not sure I understand.  There could be a race because the native
word size is 32 bits, so a 64-bit access becomes two 32-bit ones?  Or
a race because the non-atomic access can be reordered w.r.t. other
non-atomic accesses?  Both?  Neither? :-)

you respond to me, then I will put our answers together.

Maybe we ought to instrument the assembly language / machine code in
this case?  If we head down the path of instrumenting compilers other
than LLVM-based ones, especially instrumenting vendor compilers, then
our maintenance burden may quickly get out of hand.  Regardless of which
compilers we support, customers may need a tool that adds RV-Predict
instrumentation either to assembly language or to machine code.  Making
that tool helps us support both customers who use vendor compilers and
customers who need to instrument assembly, right?

I think that at this early stage of development, it is hard to answer
for RV-Predict.  Suppose we use a ring buffer like I proposed earlier.
Then I think that instrumentation for a 32-bit read, read4(t, x, v) will
look sort of like this:

	struct ring_buffer *rb = pthread_getspecific(ring_buffer_key);
	struct event *ev = rb->producer;

	if (__predict_false(ev == rb->consumer))
		wake_consumer_and_wait(rb);

	ev->op = READ4;
	ev->address = x;
	ev->value = v;

	if (ev + 1 == &rb->elts[NITEMS])
		rb->producer = &rb->elts[0];
	else 
		rb->producer = ev + 1;

That instrumentation looks like two loads, two compares, four stores, a
couple of additions, and a call to pthread_getspecific() in the common
case.  I hope that we can replace the pthread_getspecific() call with a
register access.  The compiler only has to insert some of the loads at
function entry and after every function call.  Some of the stores only
have to be performed at function exit and before every function call.
Here and there we will find an optimization to perform.  But it seems
like the instrumentation will produce at least three memory stores for
each memory load/store in the original program, and at least as many new
instructions.

I don't know how the relative rates of loads, stores, function calls,
and other instructions, so I'd have to do some research to narrow things
down further.

Should not be difficult.

I don't see why not.

Sure, we will define a tracefile format for customers to use.

Hi Kato,

I am David Young, a new engineer on Dr. Rosu's team.  I will work
primarily on RV-Predict.  Let me try to answer your questions.

You are correct, the ARM compiler and iTRON OS are unfamiliar.  It is
possible that we cannot add our instrumentation to ARM's compiler.

Is it possible for Canon to use an LLVM-based compiler?  It is my
understanding that the newest compiler from ARM, ARM Compiler 6, is
based on LLVM, so Canon may headed in that direction already.  We are
more familiar with the advantages of LLVM than with the advantages of
vendor compilers.

If necessary, we can develop instrumentation for assembly language, but
that will be more effort than instrumenting C with LLVM.

I do not have prior experience with iTRON.  I think that it should be
possible to support it, but it is difficult to estimate the level of
effort at my current level of knowledge.  I will find out more.

The increase in file size will probably be comparable to Thread
Sanitizer, 5x to 15x.

I don't think that engineers will notice much change in the compile
and link time.

The first bottleneck on the execution time will be the connection
between the system-under-test (SUT) and the PC.  Suppose that each
32-bit memory-load/store generates a 128-bit trace (a conservative
estimate).  Further, suppose that a 480-megabit USB2.0 connection
carries the traces.  Then the SUT cannot exceed 3.75 million 32-bit
loads and stores without overrunning the trace buffer.  The SUT will
have to pause while the trace buffer empties.

We may be able to preprocess the traces inexpensively on the SUT and in
that way reduce the bandwidth requirement.

We can provide a different output format, such as XML, if you prefer.

Do you mean to terminate tracing and analysis?  I think that we can add
terminate conditions ("10 minutes", "2,000,000 trace records") in a
reasonable amount of effort.

This should be possible, however, my colleague Yilong points out that
this could produce false positives.

We will be happy to provide documentation for the trace file format when
it is ready.

I expect that we will provide tools to transform from others' trace
files to our trace files, or else that we will aid customers who want to
make their own tools to perform the transformation.

Right.  I got the 5x - 15x size from the homepage.

Yes, it is likely that you will need to produce a send function that we
can link into the RV-Predict runtime on the system-under-test, and a
receive function for the other end of the communications link.

I think that we will ask for a send function that resembles
either the POSIX writev function,
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/writev.html,
or the POSIX write function,
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/write.html.

We will also ask for you to provide a function that we can call to
establish the communications link.

We do not have customers who use this function.  We would have to
produce a new function.  I think that we would make the function as
generic as possible, however, we may ask for the customer to provide a
function that returns how many event traces to produce, or for how many
seconds to record traces.  Presumably the OS will provide a clock for us
to use.

We may be able to use your feedback on the tracefile format.  I think
that I should be able to send you a draft late next week, or by early
the week after, if you would like to comment on it.

My colleagues and I have been having a lively discussion about the trace
file format.  I still need to collect the most recent comments and
update the draft document.  Then I will share it with you.

I finished extracting a pass from RV-Predict[C], and I succeeded at
adding some instrumentation with it.  I need to clean it up a bit and
commit it.

I don't have a runtime, yet.

An RV-Predict[C] event trace file starts with a header that indicates
the format and version of the file.  Following the header are the event
traces.  Traces continue right up to the end of the file, and in a
well-formed event trace, the end of file should coincide with the end of
the last trace.  In this way, you can stream a trace over a socket or
other IPC.

An RV-Predict[C] trace header is at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
header starts with 4 bytes of "magic" that serve to distinguish an
RV-Predict[C] trace file from files in other formats.  The magic
consists of the 8-bit ASCII representations for the characters 'R' 'V'
'P' '_', in that order.

Immediately following the magic is a 32-bit version number.  The initial
version number is 0.  We will increase it with every incompatible change
to the file format.  A trace-file reader MUST give up if it reads a
version number that it does not recognize.

After the version number is an 8-bit pointer width.  It tells how wide,
in bytes, a pointer is.  For a trace from a 32-bit system, it will be 4.
For a 64-bit system, 8.  You get the picture.

After the pointer width is an 8-bit default data width.  The file
reader should suppose that the first load or store trace that it sees
is this wide if it does not have more current information.  The reader
should also suppose that data narrower than the default data width was
converted to the default data width before it was written to the trace
file.  That is, if the default data width is 4, then 1- and 2-byte loads
and stores were "cast" to uint32_t before they were written to the trace
file.

After the default data width there are two bytes that pad the header to
a whole number of 32-bit words.

Here is a trace header in code:

  /* RV-Predict trace file header.  Located at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
   * trace starts at the first rv_trace_t-sized boundary after the header,
   * and it ends at EOF.
   */
  struct _rv_trace_header {
          char th_magic[4];               // 'R' 'V' 'P' '_'
                                          //
          uint32_t th_version;            // 0
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pointer_width;       // width of a pointer, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_data_width;          // default data width, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pad1[2];
  } __aligned(sizeof(uint32_t)) __packed;
  
  typedef struct _rv_trace_header rv_trace_header_t;

The event traces begin on the first address-sized boundary after the
header.  Every trace begins with an address.  Some addresses are
special: they encode an (thread id, opcode) pair, or a "throp".  The
first trace after the header MUST be a special address that encodes the
throp (thread-0, begin), where 'thread-0' identifies the thread that
starts all subsequent threads, and 'begin' is the opcode standing for
the start of a thread.

Right now I have in mind just 27 opcodes, which I assign these numbers:

        begin            0      // start of a thread
        legend           0      // alias for 'begin'
        end              1      // thread termination
        read1            2      // read: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes wide
        read2            3
        read4            4
        read8            5
        read16           6
        write1           7      // write: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes wide
        write2           8
        write4           9
        write8          10
        write16         11
        fork            12      // create a new thread 
        join            13      // join an existing thread
        acquire1        14      // exclude reads/writes on  1 byte
        release1        15
        acquire2        16      //          ...             2 bytes
        release2        17
        acquire4        18      //          ...             4 bytes
        release4        19
        acquire8        20      //          ...             8 bytes
        release8        21
        acquire16       22      //          ...            16 bytes
        release16       23
        branch          24
        enterfn         25      // enter a function
        exitfn          26      // exit a function

The first trace helps the reader to establish an important fact that
lets it interpret the following traces: addr = (thread-0, begin).  That
implies that

        addr + 1 = (thread-0, end),
        addr + 2 = (thread-0, read1),
        ...,
        addr + 26 = (thread-0, exitfn).

The RV-Predict[C] runtime reserved all of those addresses for itself
while it ran the system under test, so the reader can be certain that
whenever they appear in the trace, there is no ambiguity: they encode a
throp rather than the address for a load or store.

The first trace also helps the reader to establish some state: thread-0
is remembered as the reader's "current thread."  The reader's read/write
mode is set to 'read'.  Finally, the reader's current data width, <n>,
is set according to the data width in the trace header.

Whenever the address that starts an event trace is not a throp, the
reader interprets the address and subsequent bytes according to the
read/write mode, current thread, and current data width.  For example,
if the current thread is thread-Q, the current data width is 2, and
the read/write mode is 'read', then an event starting with non-throp address
A is interpreted as a 2-byte read by Q from address A.  If the
default data width is 4, then the 4 bytes following the address contain
the data value.

Some throps change the current thread, read/write mode, or current data
width.

Here are the trace formats that a reader must understand, their meaning,
and the changes that they make to the reader's current thread, current
data width, and read/write mode.  In effect, this is the trace grammar:

traces ::= (thread-0, legend) zero-or-more(trace)

trace ::= addr value            The current thread read/wrote
                                bytes according to current r/w mode
                                and data width.

                                Current thread is unchanged
                                Current data width is unchanged
                                Read/write mode is unchanged

I think that's enough information to start a conversation about the
format.

I think that this format has its upsides and its downsides.
And I realize, now, that there are some issues I overlooked.

Upsides:

u1) Consecutive 32-bit loads (or stores) to 32-bit addresses by the same
    thread are stored quite compactly.

u2) On a 32-bit machine, virtually all accesses by the instrumentation
    and I/O can be aligned on word boundaries, which can save cycles on
    microarchitectures like ARM.

u3) I think the implementation can be fairly simple and fast.

Downsides:

d1) The trace only tracks function entrances/exits, when it needs to
    track the instruction pointer in more detail if we're going to tell
    precisely the statements involved in data races.

d2) On a 64-bit system, storing addresses will be quite inefficient.

d3) Traces of 1- and 2-byte loads/stores are, at best, 62% and 75%
    efficient on 32-bit systems.

There are a few things that I realize, now, I have overlooked:

o1) The header should probably tell the endianness of the trace.  To
    conserve CPU cycles on the SUT, I think that the RV-Predict runtime
    should avoid performing endianness conversions.

o2) I haven't specified the alignment of any event trace but the 0th
    one.

Please send me your questions and concerns.  Thanks.

Thank you for your feedback.  Some clarification/amendment is necessary:

Some synchronization is unavoidable, be there one file per thread, or
only one file.  I think there will be no need for heavy synchronization,
which I take to mean a heavily contended lock or something.

Let me fix some of the defects in my previous proposal with some
amendments that I will describe in greater detail, later.

a0) Let's call it a trace stream instead of a trace file, because
I think that gives the right idea: it's not just a recording of
traces, but it's a form of transport.  Multiple threads' traces
will be multiplexed in one stream.

a1) Clearly, every event has to connect with a location in the source,
    somehow.  So let us say that every event includes an instruction
    pointer in some form.

a2) Recording a thread ID with every event is inefficient, because
    consecutive events on the event stream will ordinarily come from
    the same thread---if it were otherwise, that really *would* entail
    heavy synchronization.  So let's suppose that the stream contains
    occasional change-of-thread indications, and all events in the
    stream that follow a change of thread to T are ascribed thread T
    until the next change-of-thread indication.

a3) I think that we can probably combine an opcode (read, write,
    acquire, release...) with an instruction pointer in a similar
    fashion as I combined a thread ID with an opcode.

Here's my current idea of the event-logging subsystem:

### Definitions

application thread: a thread that runs the application code.  Every
    system-under-test (SUT) has at least one application thread.

log_event(e): an abstract procedure that the instrumentation on an
    application thread calls to record event `e` on a thread-local
    ring buffer.

transmission procedure: the procedure that empties application events
    from per-thread ring buffers to the backend.  The transmission
    procedure may run in a dedicated thread; then we say that there's
    an "asynchronous transmission procedure," and it runs in a thread
    called the "transmission thread."  The transmission procedure may
    run on an application thread during its log_event(e) calls; then we
    say that it's a "synchronous transmission procedure."

send function: the transmission procedure calls the send function to
    send buffers to the backend.  The customer may provide the send
    function.  Send functions may be blocking or nonblocking.

### Operation

An application thread calls log_event(e) to log an events on a
thread-local ring buffer.  The ring buffer has one writer, the thread
that it belongs to, and it has one reader, the transmission procedure,
so it's possible to use the lock-free single-writer/single-reader queue
pattern here.

When a thread finds that its ring buffer is half full, then it will
invoke the transmission procedure by waking the transmission thread or,
on a SUT having no transmission thread, by performing the transmission
procedure itself.  So that no two application threads perform the
transmission procedure simultaneously, application threads will
coordinate through some suitable synchronization mechanism.

If an application thread finds that its ring buffer is critically full
after it logs an event, then it will set the Pause flag indicating that
all application threads should stop, and then block until the flag
clears.  As each other application thread enters log_event(e), it will
also check the Pause flag and block if it is set.

Whenever the transmission procedure is invoked, it examines the ring
buffer belonging to each thread, and if it is non-empty, constructs I/O
vectors (void *buf, size_t buflen) for it.  The first I/O vector points
to a change-of-thread indication.  If the ring-buffer events belonging
to the transmission thread don't wrap, then the second I/O vector points to
them:

                           vector 2
                  >-----------------------<
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
ring    | | | | | |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x| | | | | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   ^                       ^
                consumer                producer
                pointer                 pointer
                (transmission           (application
                 procedure)              thread)

        |x| = event trace
        | | = empty slot

Otherwise, the second I/O vector indicates the first events, and
a third I/O vector indicates the rest:

         vector 3                              vector 2
        >---------<                       >---------------<
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
ring    |x|x|x|x|x| | | | | | | | | | | | |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   ^                       ^
                producer                consumer
                pointer                 pointer
                (application            (transmission)
                 thread)                procedure

        |x| = event trace
        | | = empty slot

The transmission procedure passes the I/O vectors collected from
all of the ring buffers to the send function, which initiates
transmission to the backend.

Send functions come in two varieties, blocking and nonblocking.
If the transmission procedure runs on an application thread, then
before it calls a blocking send function, it sets the Pause flag
to tell all application threads to pause.

If the transmission procedure runs on a dedicated thread, then it will
not set the Pause flag, regardless of whether or not the send function
blocks.

If the send function does not block, then the transmission procedure
will not set the Pause flag.

If the send function does block, then the transmission procedure
expects for it to return either how many bytes were sent, or an error
indication.  If the send function does not block, the transmission
procedure will expect to be notified asynchronously of the transmission
length/status.  For example, there may be an interrupt when the
length/status is ready.

After a successful transmission, the transmission procedure advances
its pointer on each ring buffer and clears the Pause flag.

Regarding the Pause flag, I gave my thinking in a previous email
(Subject: RV-Predict[C] implementation thoughts):

        The idea here is to keep some threads from pausing
        with full ring buffers while other threads race ahead,
        since I suspect that can produce 10k-event trace windows
        ([Huang, Meredith, Rosu], section 4, "Handling long traces")
        that are not very representative of the program's behavior.

> 3. Do you require `addr` in your trace to always be word aligned? If not,
> do you plan to process the trace again in the analysis backend to fix it?

The cost of unaligned words will come from the frontend.  I'm striving
to keep everything naturally aligned on the ring buffers, and to touch
data after it is written as little as possible.

On architectures like ARM, an unaligned load or store may
produce an undesirable result.  I found a detailed rundown at
<https://www.heyrick.co.uk/armwiki/Unaligned_data_access>.  I did not
know half of the complications on ARM!

An C compiler may generate four byte-sized accesses for ARM to load or
store a potentially unaligned 32-bit word---for example, a uint32_t
member of a __packed struct.

(Incidentally, looks like RV-Match detects unaligned loads and stores.
Good!)

Just in case I wasn't clear, when a thread-local buffer is half full,
I propose to transmit all buffers to the backend.  Nevertheless, the
current design suffers from the problem that you describe.

It seems that a 'release' event must not appear in a window preceding
the matching 'acquire', and there are similar considerations for 'join'
and 'end', 'begin' and 'fork'?

What if an 'acquire' appears in one window, and the matching 'release'
in a later window?  Does the backend track the state of locks across
windows?

Anyway, I spent most of yesterday on this problem, and I think I have
come up with an improvement over the global ID scheme:

I set out to pay less of a storage/bandwidth penalty (i.e., no GID per
event), to avoid writing frequently to a shared variable (GID) from
different threads, and to avoid blocking application threads.

I have in mind to begin a new "generation" of events occasionally.
Generations are identified by increasing numbers.  When events belong to
different generations, there is a happens-before relationship between
them: if generation(e1) < generation(e2), then e1 happens before e2.

A good time to begin a new generation will be when the transmission
process is invoked, however, I may begin new generations in other
conditions, too.

A window will comprise one or more consecutive generations in their
entirety.

A global generation counter, ggen, will tell the current generation
number.  Each thread will have a local generation counter, lgen.
Before it logs an event, a thread will compare ggen with lgen.  When
ggen>lgen, a thread will copy ggen to lgen and log the new lgen in
a change-of-generation (cog) event, cog(lgen).  Between event cog(lgen)
and the next cog event, the events belong to generation lgen.

It will be important to read ggen, to log any cog event, and to log a
load/store (or acquire/release, ...) in the right order, so that every
load/store event is bracketed by the correct cog events.  Given a load,
v <- mem[x], the correct order for the load and its instrumentation
seems to be this:

	v <- mem[x]		; perform the load
	gen <- mem[ggen]	; load global generation counter
	if gen > lgen:
		lgen <- gen	; update local generation counter
		log(cog(lgen))	; log the new generation
	log(load(x, v))

For a store, mem[x] <- v, and its instrumentation:

	gen <- mem[ggen]
	log(store(x, v))
	if gen > lgen:
		lgen <- gen
		log(cog(lgen))
	mem[x] <- v

I have not decided for certain how wide I will make the generation
counters, or how I will deal with wraparound.

A new generation is begun by atomically increasing mem[ggen].

If you can produce an example where this scheme assigns generation(e1) <
generation(e2) when e2 happens before e1, I would like to hear about it.

I just got the instrumentation to work with a compiler-rt built
"standalone" on the demo rv-predict-c/examples/demo/dot-product.c.

It produces a slightly different result from the RV-Predict[C] that we
distribute on the website.  In the VM, global variables are named:

        Data race on global 'dotstr' of size 24 at 0x0000014b45a0
        (a.out + 0x0000014b45b0): {{{

Not in my version:

        Data race on global '<null>' of size 0 at 0x000000000000
        (dot-product): {{{

Another difference is that there is a file called global_metadata.bin
after I run the dot-product demo with my RV-Predict[C], but in the VM,
no global_metadata.bin is produced.  Looks like I'm working from sources
that are newer than the VM.

(The string 'dotstr' doesn't appear in global_metadata.bin or in any
other .bin file, btw.)

After lunch, I will see if I can figure out why global addresses aren't
matched with their name.

Dwight,

Thanks for your feedback.  I will add something to my mockup that shows
the source lines that are involved.  I would like to put off writing any
HTML until we have a better idea of the layout.  I haven't forgotten
about the stubs.

Looking at the contract, we have the latitude to explore many styles of
interface.  We could conceivably incorporate a graphic, such as a ladder
diagram, with each report.  I have attached a couple of sketches.  The
first sketch shows a ladder diagram for this data race:

q.head (memory) is on the center rail, threads 2 and 3 are on the side
rails, and "rungs" from thread 2 to q.head and thread 3 to q.head
indicate stores.  The rung from thread 2 to q.head is bifurcated to
indicate that the order is a toss-up.  Each rung is labeled with the
value that was stored.

The second sketch shows a couple of additional ideas.  First, I show
some context: loads and stores leading up to the race condition.  Next,
the center rail becomes a plane "perpendicular" to the plane of the
sketch, representing all of memory.  On the plane of memory there are
rails for the locations involved in the race and its context: q.tailp
and q.head.

I'm just spitballing here, but I think a graphic could be very
illuminating.

These sketches are cheap to make and to throw away.  So are the
plain-text mockups.  So we should keep iterating, and involve DENSO in
the iteration pretty soon.

I welcome additional feedback.

Dave
