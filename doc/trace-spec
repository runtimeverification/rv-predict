An RV-Predict[C] event trace file starts with a header that indicates
the format and version of the file.  Following the header are the event
traces.  Traces continue right up to the end of the file, and in a
well-formed event trace, the end of file should coincide with the end of
the last trace.  In this way, you can stream a trace over a socket or
other IPC.

An RV-Predict[C] trace header is at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
header starts with 4 bytes of "magic" that serve to distinguish an
RV-Predict[C] trace file from files in other formats.  The magic
consists of the 8-bit ASCII representations for the characters 'R' 'V'
'P' '_', in that order.

Immediately following the magic is a 32-bit version number.  The initial
version number is 0.  We will increase it with every incompatible change
to the file format.  A trace-file reader MUST give up if it reads a
version number that it does not recognize.

After the version number is a 32-bit byte-order indication: this is the
word formed from the 8-bit ASCII representations of the digits 0, 1, 2,
3:  '0' | ('1' << 8) | ('2' << 16) | ('3' << 24), and written to the
stream in its producer's native byte order.  Thus, the characters appear
in the order '3' '2' '1' '0' if the producer was big-endian, and '0' '1'
'2' '3' if the producer was little-endian.

After the byte-order indication is an 8-bit pointer width.  It tells
how wide, in bytes, a pointer is.  For a trace from a 32-bit system, it
will be 4.  For a 64-bit system, 8.  You get the picture.  The reader
stores the pointer width in a variable `ptrw`.

After the pointer width is an 8-bit default data width.  The reader
should suppose that data narrower than the default data width was
converted to the default data width before it was written to the trace
file.  That is, if the default data width is 4, then 1- and 2-byte loads
and stores were "cast" to uint32_t before they were written to the trace
file.  The reader stores the pointer width in a variable `dataw`.

After the default data width there are two bytes that pad the header to
a whole number of 32-bit words.

Here is a trace header in code:

  /* RV-Predict trace file header.  Located at byte 0 of a trace file.  The
   * trace starts at the first rvp_trace_t-sized boundary after the header,
   * and it ends at EOF.
   */
  struct _rvp_trace_header {
          char th_magic[4];               // 'R' 'V' 'P' '_'
                                          //
          uint32_t th_version;            // 0
                                          //
          uint32_t th_byteorder;          // byte-order indication,
                                          // see discussion
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pointer_width;       // width of a pointer, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_data_width;          // default data width, in bytes
                                          //
          uint8_t th_pad1[2];
  } __aligned(sizeof(uint32_t)) __packed;
  
  typedef struct _rvp_trace_header rvp_trace_header_t;

The event traces begin on the first 32-bit boundary after the header.
Every trace begins with a program counter (PC).  Some program counters
are special: they encode an (delta, opcode) pair, or a "deltop".  The
`delta` tells the reader by how many bytes to move the program counter
of the current thread forward or backward: it is a two's-complement
TBD-bit signed integer.  The first trace after the header MUST begin
with the special program counter that encodes the deltop (0, begin),
where 'begin' is the opcode standing for the start of a thread.  After
the program counter is the 32-bit ID for the thread that starts all
subsequent threads.

Right now I have in mind just 28 opcodes, which I assign these numbers:

        begin            0      // start of a thread
        legend           0      // alias for 'begin'
        end              1      // thread termination
        load1            2      // load: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes wide
        load2            3

The first trace helps the reader to establish an important fact that
lets it interpret the following traces: PC = (0, begin).  That
implies that

        PC + 1 = (0, end),
        PC + 2 = (0, load1),
        ...,
        PC + 27 = (0, switch).

Likewise, for an n-bit delta field,

        PC -       2^(n-1) * 28 = (-2^(n-1), begin),
        ...,
        PC -             2 * 28 = (-2,       begin),
        PC -                 28 = (-1,       begin),
        PC +                 28 = ( 1,       begin),
        PC +             2 * 28 = ( 2,       begin),
        ...,
        PC - (2^(n-1) - 1) * 28 = (2^(n-1) - 1, begin).

The RV-Predict[C] runtime reserved all of those counters for itself
while it ran the system under test, so the reader can be certain that
whenever they appear in the trace, there is no ambiguity: they encode a
deltop rather than an instruction address.

The first trace also helps the reader to establish some state: the
thread ID is remembered as the reader's "current thread."  The reader
interprets every event according to the current thread, so it's not
necessary to record a thread ID in every event.  Operations that
establish a new current thread are 'begin' and 'switch'.

Here are the trace formats that a reader must understand, their meaning,
and the changes that they make to the reader's current thread (`self`)
and program counter (`self.PC`).  Unless otherwise noted, every program
counter and deltop begins on the first 32-bit boundary after the
previous trace. "x*" stands for "zero or more instances of x."  Here is
the trace grammar:

traces ::= (0, 'begin') thread-ID trace*

trace ::= (delta, 'load[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it read
                `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'store[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it wrote
                `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'atomic-load[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it performed an
                atomic read of `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'atomic-store[n]') addr value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and at the new program counter, it performed an atomic
                store of `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `value` is a value max(`n`, `dataw`) bytes wide,
                starting on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after
                `addr`.

                `addr` and `value` are stored in the byte order
                established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'atomic-rmw[n]') addr old-value new-value

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and at the new program counter, it performed an
                atomic read-modify-write of `n` bytes.

                `addr` is an address `ptrw` bytes wide, starting
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `n` must be a power of two.

                `old-value` is the value that `addr` had before the
                read-modify-write (rmw---e.g., atomic add) took place,
                and `new-value` is the value that `addr` took when the
                rmw was complete.

                `old-value` and `new-value` are values max(`n`, `dataw`)
                bytes wide.  If `n >= dataw`, then `old-value` starts
                on the first `dataw`-byte boundary after `addr`, and
                `new-value` starts on the first `dataw`-byte boundary
                after `old-value`.  If `n < dataw`, then `old-value`
                and `new-value` are combined into a single word with
                `old-value` in bits (dataw * 8 - 1:dataw * 4) and
                `old-value` in bits (dataw * 4 - 1:0).  The single
                `n`-byte word is written in at the first `dataw`-byte
                boundary after `addr`.  In this way, if `dataw` is 4 and
                `n` is 2, then `new-value` and `old-value` are written
                to the same 4-byte word in the trace.

                `addr`, `old-value` and `new-value` (or the combined
                word) are stored in the byte order established by the
                trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| (delta, 'cog') generation

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
		and adopted the global generation number `generation`.

                `generation` is a 64-bit unsigned integer that begins
                on the first 32-bit boundary after the deltop.  It is
                stored in the byte order established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| (delta, 'sig-est') handler signal-number mask-number

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and established, for all threads, the signal handler
                at address `handler` on signal number `signal-number`.
                `mask-number` tells the number of a previously-memoized
                signal mask (see operation `sig-mask-memo`); that mask
                will be in effect while `handler` runs for the given
                signal number.

		`handler` is an address `ptrw` that starts on the first
		32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `signal-number` and `mask-number` are 32 bits wide.
                They begin on the first 32-bit boundary after `handler`
                and `signal-number`, respectively.

                `handler`, `signal-number`, and `mask-number` are stored
                in the byte order established by the trace header.

                `handler[signal-number] <- handler`
                `handler_mask[signal-number] <- mask_memo[mask-number]`
                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| (delta, 'sig-dis') signal-number

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and disestablished its signal handler on signal number
                `signal-number`.

                `signal-number` is 32 bits wide.  It begins on the first
                32-bit boundary after the deltop.

                `signal-number` is stored in the byte order established
                by the trace header.

		`self.handler[signal-number] <- nil`
                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

	| (delta, 'enter-signal') generation signal-number

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter,
                adopted the global generation number `generation`, and
                entered the signal handler established on `signal-number`.

                XXX I should add the handler's address to this event so
                XXX that the analysis can avoid producing a model that
                XXX allows for handler X to be entered while handler Y
                XXX is established.

	| (delta, 'exit-signal') 

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and exited the last signal handler that it entered.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`
		`self.signal_depth <- self.signal_depth - 1`
		`pop(self.signal_mask_stack)`

	| (delta, 'sig-outstanding') depth

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter.
                Subsequent events occurred on the current thread at
                signal depth `depth`.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`
		`self.signal_depth <- depth`

	| (delta, 'sig-mask-memo') mask origin mask-number

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter,
                and saved the mask formed by shifting `mask` left by
                `origin` bits in slot `mask-number` of the masks table
                shared by all threads.

                `mask` is 64 bits wide.  `origin` and `mask-number` are
                both 32 bits wide.  `mask`, `origin`, and `mask-number`
                each start on the first 32-bit boundary after the previous
                element, and they are stored in the byte order established
                by the trace header.

                TBD add to this document an explanation of mask

                `mask_memo[mask-number] <- mask << origin`

	| (delta, 'mask-sigs') mask-number

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter,
                and bitwise-OR'd the memoized mask `mask-number` with
                the current effective signal mask.

                `mask-number` is 32 bits wide.  It starts on the first
                32-bit boundary after the deltop, and it is stored in
                the byte order established by the trace header.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | program-counter

                The current thread changed its program counter to
                `program-counter`.  Any value of `program-counter`
                is allowed except for the program counters that encode
                deltops.

                `self.PC <- program-counter`

        | (delta, 'begin') tid

                A new thread, `tid`, started.

                `tid` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `dataw` bytes wide.

                XXX Perhaps `tid` should be `ptrw` bytes wide, instead?
                XXX That is how I originally specified it, but
                XXX I implemented it as `dataw` bytes wide. --dyoung

                Note: with the exception of the thread that the
                trace starts off with, `tid` must have been forked
                previously, and it must not have been ended or
                joined already.

                previously, and it must not have been joined already.

                The current thread cannot perform any deltop but
                `program-counter` or `switch`.

                XXX Perhaps `program-counter` should not be allowed
                XXX after (delta, 'end'), either?

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'join') tid

                The current thread joined `tid`.

                `tid` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: `tid` must have previously terminated with
                (delta, 'end').

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'fork') tid

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and forked a new thread, `tid`.

                Note: `tid` cannot have been forked or started
                already.  `tid` must perform `(delta, 'begin')` or
                `program-counter` before any operation other than
                `program-counter`.

                XXX Perhaps (delta, 'begin') should also precede
                XXX `program-counter` ?

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'enterfn')

                The current thread added `delta` to its program
                counter and entered a function at the new program
                counter.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'exitfn')

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and, at the new program counter, returned from the
                current function.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'acquire') addr

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and acquired a lock on the byte at address `addr`.

                `addr` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: no thread may have already locked the byte.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'release') addr

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter
                and released a lock on the byte at address `addr`.

                `addr` begins on the first 32-bit boundary after
                the deltop, and it is `ptrw` bytes wide.

                Note: the current thread must hold the lock on the
                same byte.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`

        | (delta, 'switch') tid

                The current thread added `delta` to its program counter.
                Then the current thread changed to `tid` and reset the
                signal depth to 0.

                `self.PC <- self.PC + delta`
                `self <- tid`
		`self.signal_depth <- 0`

# History

Major changes from the version that was discussed on all@ mailing list: 

1) I don't align fields to the pointer width (e.g., to 8 bytes on a
   64-bit system).  Rather, 32-bit alignment.

2) I replace "throps" (thread/opcode tuples) with "deltops"
   (delta-PC/opcode tuples).

3) The trace header tells the trace byte order of the trace contents.

Major changes from the second version and the version that I
actually implemented:

4) acquire/release do not come in multiple byte widths.

5) there is no 'branch' event, since the backend doesn't support
   it

6) events were renumbered

7) 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-byte atomic read-modify-write events
   are defined.

8) 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-byte atomic load and store events are
   assigned event numbers.

9) the change-of-generation ('cog') event is defined

10) 'sig-est', 'enter-signal', 'exit-signal', 'sig-dis', 'sig-mask-memo',
    'mask-sigs' events, and 'sig-outstanding' events are defined
