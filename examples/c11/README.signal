`signal` is a POSIX Threads-using C program that modifies a shared
variable either in a couple of threads (the default mode) or else in a
thread and in a signal handler (the mode when the option `-s` is provided
on the command line).

The program demonstrates RV-Predict/C's capability to accurately model
the differences between a single thread racing with a signal handler,
and one thread racing with a second thread.

Because analysis of thread-signal and signal-signal data races takes takes
much more CPU time at the same window size than analyzing thread-thread
data races, Runtime Verification recommends configuring the environment
to select a smaller window size than usual before running `signal`:

	export RVP_WINDOW_SIZE=250

# Sources

signal.c	the test program
signals.c	sources for establishing signals and signal masks
signals.h

# Compilation

Using rvpc, a wrapper for clang that adds RV-Predict/C instrumentation, run

	rvpc -o signal signal.c signals.c

That produces an executable binary, `signal`.

# Exploring RV-Predict/C with `signal`.

If you run `signal` like this, RV-Predict/C will detect races:

	./signal

Run `signal` like this to protect the shared variable with an
atomic flag variable.  Data races still will be detected, because there
are execution orderings where the atomic flag is not protective:

	./signal -v

Add the command-line option `-s` to make `signal` run a signal
handler that modifies the shared variable, instead of running a second
thread.  Now, the atomic flag variable protects the shared variable,
and no races will be reported:

	./signal -s -v

Pass `-m` to make the thread block signals while it modifies the
shared variable, using the signal mask.  No races will be found
in that case, either:

	./signal -s -m

Finally, you can use `-m` and `-v` together with `-s`, and no races
will be detected:

	./signal -s -m -v

Or, supply only the `-m` option---i.e., no `-s` option.  Two threads
will run; setting the signal mask will not stop them from racing:

	./signal -m

The `-l` option makes the program hold a mutex while accessing the
shared variable from a *thread*.  (Mutexes must not be acquired in
signal handlers.)  A mutex is sufficient to synchronize accesses
by the threads:

	./signal -l

However, a mutex is not sufficient to synchronize a thread with
a signal:

	./signal -s -l
