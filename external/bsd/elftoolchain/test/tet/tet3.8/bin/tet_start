# NAME:		tet_start
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
# DATE CREATED:	June 1998
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# This exec tool can be used to run a test case in its own window.
# On UNIX systems the new window is created using an xterm.
#
# Normally when Distributed TETware is used, a test case's stdin is connected
# to the NULL device and stdout and stderr are connected to the tccdlog file.
# This means that it is not possible to interact with the test case.
#
# When this exec tool is used, stdin, stdout and stderr are connected to the
# newly-created window instead.
# Thus it is possible to interact with the test case in a similar way to when
# test cases are run using TETware-Lite.
#
# Instructions for using this exec tool are presented in the
# TETware User Guide.
# 
# MODIFICATIONS:
#

# remote system so we try using a full pathname first;
# on systems where xterm is called something else (e.g.: aixterm, color_xterm,
# hpuxterm etc.), or lives somewhere else, the list of locations can be
# extended as required - but plain 'xterm' should always come last
# so as to provide a default if all else fails

# The command to execute could be a test case name or another exec tool
# (possibly specified by TET_EXEC_FILE or additional words in TET_EXEC_TOOL).
# A test case is always in the current directory, but an exec tool could
# be anywhere.
#
# The name of the test case doesn't have a path prefix;
# this means that the shell won't be able to find the test case if
# PATH doesn't include the current directory.
# In order to overcome this problem we must prepend a ./ to the command
# name before invoking it, but only if necessary.
# This is only done if PATH doesn't include the current directory.
#
# If this script is being executed by a Korn type of shell
# we can use 'whence' to locate the command.
# On a Win32 system this has the added advantage of handling all the
# file name suffixes that the MKS shell understands.
# This method does "the right thing" if the command to be executed can be
# found in one of the PATH components before the current directory, even
# if an executable file of the same name exists in the current directory.
#
# However, we can't use 'whence' if this script is being executed by
# a Bourne shell, or if the command is a .pl (perl) script on a Win32 system.
# In this case the best we can do is to look for an executable file in
# the current directory.
#
# On a Win32 system the MKS shell doesn't understand a .pl suffix,
# so we must invoke perl -S to interpret a perl script.
# (-S tells perl to search for the script using PATH).
