# SCCS:   	@(#)configure	1.21 05/07/08 TETware release 3.8
# NAME:		configure
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Josey, The Open Group
# DATE CREATED:	September 1997
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	This simple script will auto configure the known operating 
#	systems which have defines.mk files included in the src/defines
#	directory.
# 
# MODIFICATIONS:
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., September 1998
#	integrated into the TETware distribution
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., November 1998
#	added support for FreeBSD
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., March 1999
#	integrated some enhancements received from Andrew Josey -
#		added support for DYNIX/ptx, Solaris 2.7, BSDI
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., September 1999
#	added support for HP-UX 11
#	added support for the Java API
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., November 1999
#	always copy the defines.mk file in case the user needs to edit it
#	for some reason; however, we still only make the file writable
#	when an edit is "expected"
#	(if the user wants to edit the file in other situations, we assume
#	they know what they are doing and thus will be smart enough to
#	figure out the "chmod u+w" for themselves!)
# 
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., March 2000
#	added support for Solaris 8
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, The Open Group, January 2002
#	updated to align with UNIX2003
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, The Open Group, May 2002
#	Added separate support for Solaris 8 and 9.
#	Added support for a Lite-only distribution.
#
#	Geoff Clare, The Open Group, November 2004
#	Added support for MacOS X (Darwin).
#
#	Geoff Clare, The Open Group, July 2005
#	Avoid using getopt.
#	Added support for Solaris 10 and QNX.
