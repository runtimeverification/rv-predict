1.  Introduction


1.1  Preface
These release notes accompany TETware Release 3.8.

There are two principle versions of TETware.  One version is known as
Distributed TETware.  This version uses a client-server architecture and
provides support for processing local, remote and distributed test cases.  The
other version is known as TETware-Lite.  This version does not use a client-
server architecture or require a network transport.  It is more simple to set
up than is Distributed TETware but does not provide support for the processing
of remote or distributed test cases.

Both versions of TETware are fully supported on UNIX operating systems and
also on the Windows NT/2000/XP operating system.  This release of TETware has
not been tested on Windows 95/98/Me, although it is expected that TETware-Lite
will still be usable on them.  However, no support is provided by The Open
Group for such use.

Throughout this document, the Windows NT/2000/XP and Windows 95/98/Me
operating systems are referred to collectively as Win32 systems.  The
individual system names are only used when it is necessary to distinguish
between them.


1.2  Audience
This document is intended to be read by software engineers and/or systems
administrators who will install TETware on their computer systems.  A
knowledge of system administration is assumed when TETware installation and
configuration instructions are presented.  In addition, a knowledge of network
administration is assumed when TETware is to be built to use network
transports.


1.3  Conventions used in this document
The following typographic conventions are used throughout this document:

   + Courier font is used for function and program names, literals and file
     names.  Examples and computer-generated output are also presented in this
     font.

   + The names of variables are presented in italic font.  You should
     substitute the variable's value when typing a command that contains a
     word in this font.

   + Bold font is used for headings and for emphasis.






                                                                        Page 1

1.5  Problem reporting

If you have subscribed to TETware support and you encounter problems when
building or executing TETware you should take a copy of the error reporting
template contained in the file tet-root/doc/tet3/err.template in the
distribution, fill in the details of the problem, and send it by electronic
mail to:

     tet_support@opengroup.org

Alternately you may use a web browser to complete and submit the HTML form
included in the file tet-root/doc/tet3/errtemp.html in the distribution.

You should include sufficient information in your report to enable someone who
is unfamiliar with your system to be of assistance in solving the problem.

Users are reminded that the user-contributed software which accompanies the
TETware distribution is not covered by TETware support services.


2.  New features and notable changes

The following features appear for the first time in this release of TETware:

   + The Python API is now part of the supported release for UNIX systems (it
     was previously user-contributed software).  Its use is dependent on
     shared-library versions of the TETware libraries being built.

   + A Distributed Korn Shell API has been added.

   + Remote systems can be disconnected within the last test purpose of a test
     case and be reconnected when the next test case is started.  The main
     purpose of this feature is to allow remote systems to be rebooted, but it
     can be used in any situation where connections to tccd on a remote system


                                                                 December 2005








                                                                   TET3-RN-3.8



     are broken and need to be re-established.  The feature must be enabled by
     adding indicators to the :remote: or :distributed: directive in the
     scenario file to specify which systems need to be reconnected, otherwise
     TETware will report disconnections as errors in the normal way.

   + Timestamps in the journal can now be in two formats.  The default is
     HH:MM:SS as in previous TETware releases.  If the TET_FULL_TIMESTAMPS
     parameter is set to True then timestamps are generated in either the
     format   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmm   or   the  format  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS,
     depending on which part of TETware generated the timestamp and whether it
     was configured to support milliseconds when built.

   + The systems.equiv file can now specify domains such as .opengroup.org and
     subnets  such  as  192.168.1.0/24,  not  just  individual  host names and
     addresses.

   + The main configure script now recognises MacOS X, Solaris 10 and QNX.

   + When any test purpose produces a result code that has  the  Abort  action
     specified  in  the  tet_code  file,  tcc  will  abort  the test run after
     processing the current test case.

More information about these features is contained in the relevant sections of
the TETware Installation Guides, User Guide and Programmers Guide.


3.  Problems fixed since the last release

The following problems have been fixed since the last TETware release:

   + The main configure script no longer uses the non-portable getopt utility.

   + By default the defines.mk  file  created  on  certified  UNIX(r)  systems
     defines  the  appropriate  standard  feature-test  macros in the compiler
     options.  This enables  support  for  milliseconds  when  the  new  full-
     timestamps  feature  is  used,  and  also  enables  the use of standards-
     compliant code in other areas mentioned below.  The standard feature-test
     macros  are also defined by default for other systems that recognise them
     but are not UNIX(r) certified, such as Linux.

   + The POSIX Shell API was using some old-style trap reset commands with  no
     dash  (trap  signal_list).  These have been changed to use a dash (trap -
     signal_list).

   + The tet_vprintf() function in the C API  library  no  longer  produces  a
     bogus  ``unexpected EOF'' warning message when va_copy is not defined and
     the formatted output is an empty string.

   + tccd now always accepts connections from the host name localhost,  so  it
     no longer needs to be specified in systems.equiv.



                                                                        Page 3








                                                      Test Environment Toolkit
                                         Release Notes for TETware Release 3.8


   +  The  address  length  argument  to  the  accept(),   getsockname()   and
     getpeername()  functions  is  now passed as a pointer to socklen_t if the
     standard feature-test macros for UNIX98, UNIX03 or POSIX01  are  defined,
     and as a pointer to size_t if the standard feature-test macros for UNIX95
     are defined.  (Otherwise it is a pointer to int as before.)

   + In TETware-Lite, tcc was not passing trace flags down to the TCM.

   + The standard poll() function is now used  if  the  standard  feature-test
     macros  for  UNIX95, UNIX98 or UNIX03 are defined.  (Previously it had to
     be enabled by defining SVID3_POLL.)

   + The tet_eaccess() library function now passes a buffer large  enough  for
     NGROUPS_MAX+1  groups (which getgroups() can return on UNIX03 and POSIX01
     systems).  It has also been changed  to  avoid  non-portable  assumptions
     about mode values.

   + The directory /var/tmp has been added to the default  list  of  temporary
     directories  that  the  tet_mktfname() library function tries to use.  It
     has also been changed to report an error (and a  suggestion  to  set  the
     TMPDIR  environment  variable)  if  none  of the directories it tries are
     usable.

   + The standard setsid() function is now  used  if  the  feature-test  macro
     _XOPEN_SOURCE  is  defined.   Previously  its  use  was  only  enabled by
     defining _POSIX_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE or HAS_SETSID.

   + In the Java API the compareTPs() function in SimpleTestCase.java has been
     changed to use a numeric comparison.

   + In src/tet3/inetlib/nbio.c non-portable headers are now only included  if
     no standard feature-test macros are defined.

   + The bogus endpwent() call has been removed from src/tet3/tccd/tccd.c.

   + In places where code previously  tried  to  calculate  the  maximum  time
     interval  representable  as  a time_t value by using bit-shifting, it now
     uses a simple fixed value of 2147483647 seconds.

   + A few other minor portability improvements  have  been  made  in  various
     places  in  the  C  code,  such  as  eliminating  some  implicit function
     declarations that had not been caught before.

5.  Building and installing TETware


5.1  Building and installation instructions
For information on how to build and  install  TETware,  please  following  the
instructions  in  the  version  of  the  TETware  Installation  Guide which is
appropriate for your system.

Note:  In this release the Java API may be built on Solaris, Linux  and  Win32
      systems.   In  order  to  build the Java API on these systems a variable
      must be set in the  defines.mk  file  which  specifies  where  the  Java
      Development Kit (JDK) has been installed on your machine.

      On Solaris Release 7 and later the JDK is supplied  with  the  operating
      system  and  so  is  installed  in  a  standard place (/usr/java).  This
      location is specified in the defines.mk files for such systems that  are
      supplied in the distribution.

      However, on other platforms the JDK might be installed anywhere,  so  it
      is  necessary to customise your defines.mk file if you want to build the
      Java API.  Refer to the section entitled ``Support  for  Java''  in  the
      TETware Installation Guide for instructions on how to do this.

      In the defines.mk file on UNIX systems it is necessary  to  specify  the
      list  of  signals  that  are  used by the Java Virtual Machine, so as to
      avoid conflict with the use of signals by the TETware Java  API  runtime
      support  library.   This  signal list may change, depending on which JDK
      and/or operating system version you are using.

      The defines.mk files for various UNIX platforms on which the Java API is
      supported  contain signal lists for particular JDK versions.  If you are
      using a different JDK version you may need to change this list.   Please
      refer  to  the  section  entitled  ``Support  for  Java'' in the TETware
      Installation Guide for UNIX Operating Systems for further details.


5.2  Installed platforms

5.2.1  UNIX systems

                                         Release Notes for TETware Release 3.8


   + Solaris 10 using the Sun Studio 10 c99 compiler (sparc-64)

5.2.2  Win32 systems

TETware-Lite and Distributed TETware have been installed and tested  on  Intel
PCs running Windows 2000.

5.3  API status


5.3.1  Thread-safe APIs on Win32
On Win32 systems the thread-safe APIs must be used with the multi-threaded DLL
version  of the C runtime support library.  Use with the multi-threaded static
version of the C runtime support library is not supported.


5.3.2  Java
The Java API is supported on Linux, Solaris 8 and later, and Win32 systems.


5.3.3  Perl
The Perl API uses perl 5 syntax such that it executes  without  warnings  when
run under the control of perl -w.  However, test case authors should note that
perl test cases may still  emit  warnings,  when  run  under  the  control  of
perl -w,  about  API  interface  variables defined in the test case only being
used once.  For example, consider the following trivial perl test case:

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     @iclist=("ic1");
     @ic1=("tp1");

     $tet'startup = "startup";
     $tet'cleanup = "cleanup";
     sub startup
     {
             &tet'infoline("in startup function");
     }

     sub cleanup
     {
             &tet'infoline("in cleanup function");
     }
     sub tp1
     {
             &tet'infoline("This is tp1 in a simple perl test case");
             &tet'result("PASS");
     }

     require "$ENV{\"TET_ROOT\"}/lib/perl/tcm.pl";




                                                                 December 2005








                                                                   TET3-RN-3.8



When run with perl -w, the following warnings are generated from the test case
source file:

     Name "tet::startup" used only once: possible typo at simple.pl line 6.
     Name "tet::cleanup" used only once: possible typo at simple.pl line 7.
     Name "main::ic1" used only once: possible typo at simple.pl line 4.
     Name "main::iclist" used only once: possible typo at simple.pl line 3.

When Perl version 5.6 or later is used,  it  is  possible  to  suppress  these
warnings by use of the our keyword in the test case source file.  For example:

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     @iclist=("ic1");
     @ic1=("tp1");

     $tet'startup = "startup";
     $tet'cleanup = "cleanup";
     our(@iclist, @ic1);                                                        Ç

     {                                                                          Ç
             package tet;                                                       Ç
             our($startup, $cleanup);                                           Ç
     }                                                                          Ç
     rest of test case ...

In this example the code that has been added  in  order  to  suppress  warning
messages is indicated by a <- character in the right margin.


5.4  Transport-specific status

5.4.1  Sockets network interface

The sockets network interface is the preferred configuration  for  Distributed
TETware  and  its  use  is  recommended  over  XTI on all systems that support
sockets.

5.4.2  XTI network interface

There is a known problem with some  SVR4  XTI  implementations  in  which  the
t_sync()  function  does  not  work correctly.  An XTI implementation may hold
transport endpoint data either in  kernel  or  in  user  address  space.   The
t_sync()  function  is  included  in  the XTI specification for the benefit of
implementations which do not automatically detect when the transport  endpoint
data  held  in user space is lost.  Examples of when such loss might occur are
when the file descriptor underlying a transport endpoint is  duplicated  using
fcntl()  or  when  the  process address space is overlaid by one of the exec()
system calls.

Since the XTI version of TETware may perform both of these operations, it will
not function when used with an XTI implementation which does not automatically


                                                                        Page 7

detect the loss of data held in user address space and in which t_sync()  does
not perform the advertised function.  A common symptom of this problem is when
