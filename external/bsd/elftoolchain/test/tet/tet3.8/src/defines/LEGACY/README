SCCS: @(#)README	1.1 (98/09/01) TETware release 3.8

The defines.mk files in this directory relate to legacy systems to which
the TETware developers no longer have access.

They are still included in the distribution in case they are of use to
anyone but it is likely that they will need some attention before
TETware can be compiled on these systems.
