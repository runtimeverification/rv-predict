# NAME:		hpux10.mk
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
# DATE CREATED:	July 1998
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for HP/UX R10.01 using sockets and inetd
#	no threads yet
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
# 
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1999
#	Added support for the Java API.
# 
# ************************************************************************


# In Distributed TETware, tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user (not recommeded!)
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD specifies the name by which tccd is to be known; this should be in.tccd
# if you define INETD, otherwise it should be tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

# TET and DTET defines; one of these is added to CDEFS in each compilation
#	TET_CDEFS are used to compile most source files
#	    these should include -D_POSIX_SOURCE 
#
#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking and threads
#	    for example:
#	    inet:  DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DINETD
#	    xti:   DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DTCPTPI
