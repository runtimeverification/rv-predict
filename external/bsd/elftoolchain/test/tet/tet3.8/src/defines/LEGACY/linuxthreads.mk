#
#	Andrew Josey, The Open Group, September 1998

# In Distributed TETware, tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user (not recommeded!)
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD specifies the name by which tccd is to be known; this should be in.tccd
# if you define INETD, otherwise it should be tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

# TET and DTET defines; one of these is added to CDEFS in each compilation
#	TET_CDEFS are used to compile most source files
#	    these should include -D_POSIX_SOURCE 
#
#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking
#	    for example:
#	    inet:  DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DINETD
#	    xti:   DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DTCPTPI

# CDEFS is used to specify -I, -D and -U options

# object files that are to be put in a shared library.
# On many systems the option(s) specified here instructs the compiler
# to generate position-independent code.

# on your system or if you don't want to build the shared versions of the
# API libraries.

# SHLIB_CC names the compiler that is used when generating the object files

# lists of import and export functions as well as calling $(CC)

# SHLIB_BUILD names the utility that builds a shared library from a set of
# object files.
# Often this utility is $(CC) invoked with special options, or it might be

# JAVA_CDEFS is used in addition to TET_CDEFS/DTET_CDEFS when compiling
# the Java API.

# Set JAVA_CDEFS to JAVA_NOT_SUPPORTED if Java is not supported on your
# system or if you don't want to build the Java API.
#
# Although the Java API is supported on Linux, the location of the JDK
# on your machine must be specified here before you can build the Java
# API support library.
# For example, if the JDK is installed in /usr/local/java on your machine,
# you would say:
# JAVA_CDEFS = -I/usr/local/java/include -I/usr/local/java/include/genunix \
# 	-DTET_SIG_LEAVE='SIGALRM,SIGSEGV,SIGIO,SIGCHLD,SIGINT,SIGQUIT,SIGBUS,\
# 		SIGILL,SIGABRT,SIGFPE,SIGTRAP,SIGXCPU,SIGXFSZ,SIGPIPE'
# but because I don't know where the JDK is installed on your machine,
# for now I must say:
JAVA_CDEFS = JAVA_NOT_SUPPORTED
# See "Support for Java" in the TETware Installation Guide for UNIX systems
# for more details.

# JAVA_COPTS is used in addition to COPTS when compiling the Java API.
