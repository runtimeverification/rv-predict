#	TETware release 3.8
#
#	slave system build mode configuration file for the TETware
#	demonstration
#
#	most of the configuration variables are inherited from the
#	master system
#
#	only variables that are specific to the slave system appear here
#

#
#	the build tool:
#
# when the slave is a UNIX-like system or both master and slave systems
# are of the same type, the value of TET_BUILD_TOOL to use is the one
# inherited from the master system
#
# when the master is a UNIX-like system and the slave is a Windows NT system,
# set TET_BUILD_TOOL to "./ntbuild.ksh" in this file, thus:
#
# TET_BUILD_TOOL=./ntbuild.ksh
