/* This is a linker script.  Its directives tell the linker how to
 * construct a binary from the text and data defined by a program's
 * object files.
 *
 * `rvpc` uses this linker script to gather the variables annotated
 * __rv_register in every object file into one data section called
 * `.data.registers`.  The `INSERT AFTER` statement ensures that the
 * linker script augments the default linker script instead of replacing
 * it.
 *
 * This linker script introduces two symbols that we can access from C,
 * `__data_registers_begin` and `__data_registers_end`, which point at
 * the first byte of the section and the byte *after* the last byte of
 * the section.  The runtime declares both the pointers `extern const
 * char * const`, so it can "measure" the data-register section,
 * `ptrdiff_t register_section_size =
 *     __data_registers_begin - __data_registers_end;` 
 *
 * It is useful to measure the data-register section so that the runtime
 * knows how much memory to allocate for register "metadata."
 * It is useful to know where the section begins, `__data_registers_begin`,
 * so that a reference to any register, `regp`, can be converted to an
 * index into the metadata, `regp - __data_registers_begin`.
