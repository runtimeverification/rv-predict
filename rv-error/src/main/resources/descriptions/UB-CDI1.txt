According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to provide an initializer list for a scalar with multiple elements. In practice this may be a compiler error which prevents your application from being built, or a compiler warning which silently ignores all but one of the initializer elements in the list; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagniostic be emitted for this case. The solution is to either fix the type so that the declaration has an aggregate type, if multiple values were intended, or to remove all but one initializer element, if the declared type is correct.
