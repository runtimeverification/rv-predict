According to ISO C11, if the second operand of an integer modulus operation is 0, the behavior is undefined. In practice this generally leads to abnormal program termination, but it can also go into a trap handler or raise a signal instead, depending on the platform. The solution is that if the second operand can be zero, to check for zero modulus explicitly and handle it separately.
