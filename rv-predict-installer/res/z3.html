<h2>We have detected that Z3 is not installed.</h2><hr><br><br>
Z3 is a constraint solver required by RV-Predict to detect races in <br>
programs.  To use RV-Predict, you must install Z3 from the link below <br>
and add it to your system's PATH.  Once Z3 is installed, check the <br>
checkbox below.<br><br>
Alternatively, it is possible to use Yices, a different constraint <br>
solver, with RV-Predict.  Please skip this step and see the README <br>
after install for instructions on using Yices with RV-Predict.
